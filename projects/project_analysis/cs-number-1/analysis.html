            <li>
                In the preliminary analysis, correlation coefficients were calculated between all the features and found that minhours and  grade showed a weak negative correlation (r = -0.16), which was interesting.
            </li>
            <li>
                Further inspection of the correlation heat map (Figure 1) revealed that grade showed the highest negative correlation with difficulty (r = -0.40) and in turn, difficulty showed the highest positive correlation with minhours (r = 0.62).
            </li>
            <li>
                Then, it was thought that these three variables (minhours, grade, and difficulty) are inter-related and that difficulty could be a confounding variable that resides between (minhours and grade); the simple correlation coefficient between minhours and grade might not reflect a true relationship between them.
            </li>
            <li>
                It could be natural to think that study time correlates with grade, but the preliminary analysis showed opposite results. Thus, the partial correlation between minhours and grade while controlling difficulty was focused on.

        </div>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Since the simple correlation assumes that data points are normally distributed (at least not highly skewed), the distribution of three variables (minhours, grade, and difficult) using weighted histograms (Figure 2) were examined.
            </li>
            <li>
                Raw dataset showed highly skewed distributions for (minhours and  grade).
            </li>
            <li>
                Outliers were first removed; outliers were defined as those values less than Q1 - 1.5 IQR or Q3 + 1.5 IQR, where Q1, Q3, and IQR are first quantile (25 percentile), third quantile (75 percentile), and interquartile range (Q3 - Q1).
            </li>
            <li>
                After removing the outliers, minhours did not show severe skew but grade still showed skew. In grade variable values, there was a peak at '4', which implies that there are some courses in which all students received 'A' (hereafter referred to as 'all-A courses'). Manual inspection of data showed that the class sizes of most all-A courses are very small.
            </li>
            <li>
                After applying Box Cox transformation, the skew of grade was in part removed but the peak caused by all-A courses remained.

                Correlation analysis on outlier-removed dataset was performed (Fig. 3 and 4 and Table 1) and Box Cox transformed dataset (see Table 2) with or without all-A courses. For scatter plots, datasets with all-A courses were used.

            <li>
                As shown in Table 1, the correlation analysis results were similar whether including all-A courses or not. This may be due to the use of "weighted correlation" and the class-size being small for the all-A courses (see the size of markers in the top of scatter plots showing grade in Fig 1).
            </li>

            <li>
                As shown in raw data, correlations between difficult and minhours and between difficult and grade are strong, and negative correlations (-0.29) between minhours and grade are weak but significant (\(p < 0.05\)).
            </li>

            <li>
                After controlling difficult, minhours and grade showed positive partial correlation (+0.16), which is also weak but significant (\(p < 0.05\)).
            </li>
            <li>
                â˜… Thus, \(H_0\) was rejected in favor of \(H_A\).
            </li>
            <li>
                This result implies that the negative correlation between minhours and grade could be due to students spending more time to study difficult courses. The positive partial correlation between  minhours and grade suggests that, when the effect of course difficulty is excluded, the more students study the better they can achieve good grades.

        <ul>
            <li>
                When BoxCox transformation was applied, correlation coefficients are slightly strengthened but overall correlation patterns did not considerably differ from those obtained using outlier-removed datasets. Similarly, exclusion of all-A courses only slightly increased the correlation coefficient. They also did not affect the result of hypothesis test.
            </li>
            <li>
                Thus,outlier-removed dataset with all-A courses were used for the subsequent analyses.
            </li>
            <li>
                The reason for including all-A courses was that values from these courses are actually not outliers and the effects of these courses could be negligible because the class-size of these courses are very small as shown in scatter plots (Fig. 1) and the use of "weighted" correlations.
            </li>
            <li>
                The reason for not using BoxCox transformation (in spite of that it slightly improves normality of datasets) was due to intention of remaining the scales of the original dataset for the convenience of result interpretations.
            </li>
            <li>
               Correlation and partial correlation for the groups of courses were investigated to see if overall pattern changes (Simpson's paradox). For this purpose, outlier-removed dataset with all-A courses were used. The course grouping was done according to Brown's Critical Review database.
            </li>
            <li>
                To obtain reliable results, course areas with more than 100 courses were included in this study; they are BIOL (biology), CLPS (Cognitive Linguistic and Psychological Sciences), CSCI (computer science), ECON (economics), ENGN (engineering), HIST (history), MATH (mathematics).
            </li>
        </ul>

        </div>

        <ul>
            <li>
                For BIOL and CSCI courses, \(H_0\) cannot be rejected. This result implies that in BIOL and CSCI courses, minimum study hours are not associated with grade received. Such results could be due to that BIOL and CSCI courses showed very strong positive correlations (\(\rho > 0.8\)) between difficult and minhours.
            </li>
            <li>
                ENGN courses showed a very exceptional pattern. For ENGN courses, \(H_0\) was rejected  but negative partial correlation was significant.
            </li>
            <li>
                Considering that significant partial correlation can be either positive or negative, it could be better to use one-tailed test. However, in any cases (including all BROWN courses) where \(H_0\) was rejected, \(H_0\) was rejected with big margin. Thus, one-tailed test would not alter our results.

                Correlation does not explain causal relationship. However in our case, grade received could be the response/dependent variable and difficult and minhours could be the explaining/independent variable.
            </li>
            <li>
                Partial correlation coefficient can be calculated while controlling more than two variables. In this study, only one variable (difficult) was controlled. Further studies controlling more variables could provide more comprehensive insight into the relationships between them.
            </li>
            <li>
                Correlation explains 'linear' relationships between variables. In this study, by looking at the scatterplots, the variables that showed significant correlation appeared to have linear relationships (Fig 3). However, although not tested thoroughly, it is suspected that the relationship between difficulty and minhours might not be linear but possibly exponential.

            Effect of confounding variable "difficult"
        </div>
        The correlation that we observe could be due to the effect of several confounding variables stemming from our use of self reported results. For instance, it could be the case that students who are more focused on a course tend to overreport the number of hours spent on the course and also perform better because of that focus. As another example, students who get higher grades may retroactively justify these grades with higher hours spent (the hours reported is given when the students already have a good idea of what grade they will be receiving).
        Since this is not an experiment, we cannot draw any causal relationship between the two variables. We can only make correlations between self-reported hours spent and difficulty instead of more absolute measures. It is nevertheless interesting that this data suggests that students are independently able to converge on a somewhat consistent definition of difficulty such that at the same difficulty level we can observe that students report higher hours when they have better grades.

                <br/>
                Our objective is to test for partial correlation coefficient as explained in detail in the
                <i>Hypothesis</i> section; statistical test as opposed to ML algorithm seemed to be an obvious choice. We considered linear regression as well; however our main interest was not causal relationship. Success or failure was measured by significant p-value. The metric was chosen because Ha is tested against H0 at significance level of alpha = 0.05 (two tailed, t-distribution). Some challenges included preprocessing the data as discussed in <i>Methods</i>; decisions such as how to preprocess invalid data (NaN vs. Imputation) and how to normalize data (Box Cox transformation vs. log transformation, whether to remove all-A-courses were difficult to make). Yes, we cleaned our data as discussed in <i>Methods</i>.

                </b>
                <br/>
                The choice of graphs were quite obvious. Graphical representation such as Figure 4 was designed best to communicate the result. An alternative way to communicate the result would be graphical comparisons of only the partial correlation coefficients. No, there werenâ€™t any challenges.
