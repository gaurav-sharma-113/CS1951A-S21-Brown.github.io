README --- Analysis Deliverable

Task Details
Hana - collected more data from the Google Android Security Reports (2014-2018) concerning the Potentially Harmful Application (PHA malware) install rates on Android devices. Produced three graphs detailing the trends of PHA install rates on devices and specific PHA categories (Trojan, SMS Fraud, and Spyware). On top of the old data, attached is a CSV file "PHA-installs.csv" with that information. 

Chisom - collected data regarding overprivileged apps downloaded onto Androids and created a bar chart to showcase the frequency with which permission is granted to apps that the user is unaware of. The chart also shows the more popular type of permissions granted to apps on Android OS, top 10 include: user accounts, ability to edit contacts, call phone and wifi states.

David - labeled previously collected image data, utilize OpenCV image augmentation to create 3000 more images through mirroring, augmented images to fit the model and ran the model
utilizing an 80/20 train/test split with 4 different methods of prediction to analyze the results. 

Jesus - Collected App data(drebin215dataset5560malware9476benign.csv) and used to create three regression models(using all permissions, some permissions, and number of permissions as variables for the three models). Produced two tables, one where the tests statistics of each model are given and another where we list the correlation coefficients of the top 5 permissions with highest absolute value of coefficient from the model that uses all the variables.
