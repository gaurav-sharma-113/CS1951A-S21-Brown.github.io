DATA SPEC
________________________________________________________________________________

Hypothesis:
The month with the most consecutive cold/hot days is the month with the highest
(a) residential natural gas consumption and (b) residential electricity
consumption.
________________________________________________________________________________

Overview:
- We will define what constitutes a "cold" or "hot" day based on our data
- The region we are focusing on are the states of New England: Rhode Island, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire
- Time frame: January 1, 2010 - December 31, 2019

I. Data sources

We collected our data from the following government agencies:

- Temperatures: United States National Centers for Environmental Information
(NCEI)
- Residential natural gas consumption & electricity consumption: United States
Energy Information Administration (EIA)

II. Format of the Data
Date | New Hampshire (NH) MAX temp | NH MIN temp | NH electricity sales (MM kWh) | NH Natural Gas Consumption (MCF) | ...(same columns for all other states) ...

- Since minimum/maximum temperatures are recorded daily but energy/electricity
consumption is recorded monthly, we include the monthly energy/electricity
consumption of each state in the first day of each month.
- All fields in the table are required. However, since we are only recording
monthly energy/electricity consumption on the first day of each month, all other
days of that month will contain empty values.
