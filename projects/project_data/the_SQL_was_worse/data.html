        <h3> Where is the data from? </h3>
        <p>We collected our data for movies from an API on The Movie DB(TMDb).
            We collected our data on Oscar winners and nominees from open-source 
            datasets on Kaggle, which sourced
            their data from The Official Academy Awards Database and Notable 
            Names Database (NNDB) </p>
        <b>How did you collect your data?</b>
        <p>From the TMDb API, we retrieved primary information, cast, release
                information, and reviews from the movies, and
                primary information and credits from the people. The NNDB dataset
                provides information about the demographics of the actors.</p>
        <b>Is the source reputable?</b>
        <p> The data from TMDb is often accepted as a trusted platform as
            millions of people use their resources. The Official Academy
            Awards Database is also reputable since their database is made
            by the Award Academy. While the NNDB dataset is from a website
            we found, for each column in the dataset, there is another
            column indicating the confidence in the demographic fact. This
            allows us to see if the creators of the dataset were not 100%
            certain about the facts on the actors. </p>
        <b>How did you generate the sample? Is it comparably small or large? 
            Is it representative or is it likely to exhibit some kind of sampling 
            bias?</b>
            <p>
            The sample is generated by taking a group of rows with 
            birthplace_confidence level of 1. It is comparably small to the 
            entire set of data because it only looks at three years.
            It is likely to exhibit some sampling bias because the actors and 
            their demographics at the tail ends look different than those in 
            the mid-1990s.
            </p>
            
        <b>Are there any other considerations you took into account when
            collecting your data? This is open-ended based on your data;
            feel free to leave this blank.</b>
        <p>By looking at only Oscar nominated actors, we are aware that the
        level of racial diversity among our pool of actors is limited.
        Thus, we may have to look at sexuality, place of birth and gender
        as our key demographics. </p>
        <br>

        <h3>How clean is the data? Does this data contain what you need in
            order to complete the project you proposed to do?</h3>
        <p>The data is fairly clean, although there are some special characters
            in names in both the movies and actors data, such as those with
            accents, that did not parse correctly as strings and thus these
            values may need to be discarded.</p>
        <b>How many data points are there total? How many are there in each
            group you care about? Do you think this is enough data to do what you hope to do? </b>
        <p>In the database labeled <oscars class="db"></oscars>,
                there are:
                <ul>
                    <li>actors - 2112 rows</li>
                    <li>allmovies - 95415 rows </li>
                    <li>awards - 11303 rows </li>
                    <li>demographics - 471 rows</li>
                    <li>merged - 11682 rows </li>
                </ul>       
                <br>
                In the actors data, which is the group that represents the
                actual full sample size on which we will test our hypothesis,
                there are 2112 data points. We believe there is a sufficient
                amount of data to test our hypothesis that race, sexual
                orientation and place of birth affects the number of film
                credits that it takes an actor to reach commercial and
                critical success. We also have access to revenue, reviews, and
                all Oscar nominations to determine critical and commercial
                success levels.</p> 

        <b>Are there missing values? Do these occur in fields that are
            important for your project's goals? </b>
        <p>The original open-source datasets lacked information on
        Oscar winners/nominees for some of the most recent award
        ceremonies (2018-2019).
        We manually entered those years' info into the data tables.
        There are also some actors whose demographic information is
        missing or incomplete. We will discard these data points.</p>
        <b>Are there duplicates? Do these occur in fields that are important
            for your project's goals? </b>
        <p>There are of course actors who have won/been nominated for multiple
        Academy awards. For these individuals, their demographic data is only
        entered once, so we do not double count their identities.</p>
            
        <b>How is the data distributed? Is it uniform or skewed? Are there
            outliers? What are the min/max values? </b>
            <p>The data is uniformally distributed. We do not have other comments
            as our data points (the actors) are not numerical, but we will
            create a threshold value of success in the modeling phase when
            we associate a list of films with each actor.</p>
        <b>Are there any data type issues (e.g. words in fields that were
            supposed to be numeric)? Where are these coming from?
            (E.g. a bug in your scraper? User input?) How will you fix them? </b>
            <p>Our movies data is currently in JSON format. The credits
            attribute currently exists as JSON object for each movie in
            the movies table. We will address this in our analysis by parsing
            through each JSON object that represents the credits of a movie and
            building a list of credited films for each actor (to determine how
            many credits it takes them to reach our success threshold)</p>
        <b>Do you need to throw any data away? What data? Why? Any reason
            this might affect the analyses you are able to run or the conclusions
            you are able to draw?</b>
            <p>For some of our analysis, we need to throw away the entries
            from the Oscar nominee/winner data for which there was no demographic data available.</p>
        <br>
        <h3> Summarize any challenges or observations you have made since
            collecting your data. Then, discuss your next steps and how your
            data collection has impacted the type of analysis you will perform. </h3>
           <p>In the collection stage, we found that our original plan to
            look at all actors (including successful and unsuccessful) to see
            if those from certain areas and with certain education levels were
            more likely to succeed was too large of a scope. We could not find
            detailed demographic and filmic information about unsuccessful
            actors, and so we decided instead to look at a pool of successful
            actors (those with Oscar nominations) and to see if those of certain
            identities reached success faster than others.
            During our data collection, we noticed that there was not always
            complete demographic information on the subset of actors which we
            are examining, or that the information provided was not given with
            full confidence. During our analysis, we will factor this in by
            making sure that in our sample of Oscar-nominated actors we place
            greater weight on the data points with higher confidence of the
            demographic data. Our next steps include writing queries on the
            actor data to find the number of movies they appeared in and
            doing statistical analysis to understand the time path of success
            of actors across different demographic categories.</p>
