The twitter, reddit, and Urban Dictionary downloaded datasets are taken from these three sources:

Twitter Shallow Stream Grab: https://archive.org/details/twitterstream
Reddit: http://files.pushshift.io/reddit/
Urban Dictionary: http://urbanscraper.herokuapp.com

The format of the data for our database is such that each row contains an individual tweet/post/comment (text), a unique id (id), and date (date).

There are two tables in the SQL database- one for each Twitter and Reddit. Both tables contain the same components with differences in data type to store different sizes of text. 

text - the text of a tweet/post/comment. Reddit has a character limit of 40,000 characters. Thus
       text will be stored as VARCHAR(40000) in the Reddit table. For Twitter, we will use VARCHAR(288).

date - DATE type -- YYYY-MM-DD

id - an auto-incremented unique identifier for each individual tweet/post/comment.
