            <h3> Data Sample</h3>
            <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1fX6GMnkJRIZndcqoJxM6a-PwOSgdg2yU"> Here's a sample of our
                data!</a>
            <p>
                Where is the data from?
                <ul>
                    <li> The data is from SportRadar (sportradar.us). We know it is reputable because it is an offical
                        partner of the NFL for distributing game statistics. </li>
                </ul>
                How do we generate the sample?

                <ul>
                    <li> We generated the sample by taking the game statistics for one particular game from our whole
                        dataset. The sample is comparatively small as our full dataset has hundreds of thousands of
                        rows, while the sample has 100. The bias exists at the level of the game itself. That is, there
                        is bias in the sense that the referees and the data analysts use their judgment to determine the
                        markers of a play (ex. yard marker, fouls, etc).
                    </li>
                </ul>
                How clean is the data?
                <ul>
                    <li>We expect the data to be relatively cleaned given that this is the official API associated with
                        the NFL. This project has more than enough information we need for a Deep Learning algorithm, as
                        it has more that 100 different data points to use.

                    </li>
                </ul>
                How many data points are there in total?
                <ul>
                    <li>For one year, for each team, we had 16 data points (one for each game). For one year, for each
                        player, we have 16 data points as well. This would be enough per year given that there are over
                        200 values per player and team per game.

                    </li>
                </ul>
                How many data points are there in total?
                <ul>
                    <li>For one year, for each team, we had 16 data points (one for each game). For one year, for each
                        player, we have 16 data points as well. This would be enough per year given that there are over
                        200 values per player and team per game.

                    </li>
                </ul>
                Are there missing values? <ul>
                    <li>No, there are no missing values.

                    </li>
                </ul>
                Are there duplicates? <ul>
                    <li>No, there are no duplicates because every team has a different name, and for each team, there
                        are no two players of the exact same name. Despite the fact that theoretically they could have
                        the same name, we looked through all the data an confirmed that there are no duplicatees per
                        team. There may be duplicates across teams, but this does not matter as we are associating each
                        player to a team.

                    </li>
                </ul>
                How is the data distributed? <ul>
                    <li>There will many 0 values in our data. NFL players are highly specialized to a role, so they
                        will not produce nonzero values for most data metrics. For example, a quarterback will never
                        produce interceptions. There is no definite max values, though we do not expect scores to exceed
                        1000. We also expect the score to be somewhere between 0 and 100 inclusive, for a team in a
                        game. For an offensive player, we expect the number of touchdowns to to range between 0 to 15
                        inclusive. Defensively, we consider numerous data points such as sacks, which we expect to be
                        between 0 and 20 inclusive per game.

                    </li>
                </ul>
                Are there datatype issues? <ul>
                    <li>Yes there are datatype issues. We will need to convert string values into integers.

                    </li>
                </ul>
                Do you need to throw data away? <ul>
                    <li>Yes. Depending on the position of the player, certain metrics are negligible. For example, we
                        anticipate we can throw away sack statistics for an offensive player. This will affect our
                        analysis as it will allow our deep learning model to better focus on significant and relevant
                        data points.

                    </li>
                </ul>
                Summarize any challenges or observations you have made since collecting your data. <ul>
                    <li>A challenge we faced was determininng relevant data points for a player. We observed that some
                        players possess significant values for data points we had previously anticipated to neglect. Our
                        next step would be to begin constructing our deep learning model to learn based on the
                        aggregated statistics. We will have to decide which type of deep learning model will work most
                        effectively.
