          <h2>Setting Up</h2>
              <p>
                The <code>cs1951a_install sql</code> script installs all the stencil code you will need to your cs1951a course directory, which is <code>~/course/cs1951a/</code>.
              </p>
                To get the data files, you can either navigate to <code>/course/cs1951a/pub/sql/stencil/data/</code> and copy them, or you can run:
              <pre>cp -r /course/cs1951a/pub/sql/stencil/data ~/course/cs1951a/sql/</pre>

          </p>

          <h2> Part 0: Intro to Data Ethics </h2>
                <h3>10 points</h3>
            <p> CS1951a wants to help you identify and grapple with societal consequences at each stage of the data lifecycle.
                The design, construction, and socio-historical context of a dataset have social implications that data scientists 
                must consider when creating and using it. The goal of this section is to:
                <ul>
                    <li> Demonstrate how the design of database schemas can embed social values and/or inflict harm </li>
                    <li> Highlight a proposed process for dataset creators that raises a wide range of social and ethical concerns </li>
                    <li> Reflect on the possibilities and limitations of this process </li>
                </ul>
                

          <h3> Task </h3>

          <li> Read Section 1 (Introduction and Objectives), Section 3 (Questions and Workflow), and Section 4 (Impact and Challenges)
              of the paper "<a href = "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09010.pdf">Datasheets for Datasets</a>."</li>
          <li> Answer the questions below in <code>writeup.txt</code>. Each response should be thoughtful, 
              provide justification for your claims, and be concise but complete. 
              See the response guide linked on [__] for more guidance.</li>

          <h3> Questions </h3>
            <p>
              <ol type="1">
                <li>
                  (x points) TBD
                </li>
                <li> (x points) Which datasheet questions stood out to you? Pick three questions that are in different stages of the dataset lifecycle. 
                    For each question, provide a specific example (real or hypothetical) of a negative societal consequence that the question could help
                    a dataset user or creator to identify and/or prevent. If you find a real example online, provide a link to cite your source.

                    <i> 
                        <b>For example: </b> The questions “What mechanisms or procedures were used to collect the data? How were these mechanisms or 
                        procedures validated?” could have helped identify and prevent errors in automatic COVID-19 data collection in England. Public 
                        Health England used an outdated Excel file format in their automatic process to pull COVID-19 data together, leading nearly 
                        16,000 coronavirus cases to go unreported. If the dataset creator had thought of procedures to validate this process ahead of 
                        time, they could have identified the loss of data earlier and prevented the threat to public health efforts.

                    but is not addressed by the proposed datasheet system. Propose a modification or addition to the datasheet system that helps address 
                    this issue. Your proposal could involve new sections, questions, external infrastructure, incentives, and more! Explain how your

            <h3>SQLite</h3>
                <p>
                    SQLite is installed on all department machines. It can be accessed from the command line using <code>sqlite3</code>.
                    Running <code>sqlite3 somedb.db</code> from your terminal will launch an environment that will allow you to type your SQL queries directly into the terminal. You can exit this environment by pushing Ctrl+D or by typing <code>.exit</code> and pressing enter.</p>
                <p>
                    As a more explicit example, to open a sql environment where you can query the <code>movies.db</code> database, you can type:
                </p>
                <p>
                <code>$ sqlite3 movies.db</code>
                </p>
                <p>To execute a SQL statement that you have saved in a solution file, you can run the following command:</p>
                    <code>$ sqlite3 movies.db &lt; sql_solutions.sql</code><br><br>

                    For more information on using SQLite from the command line, see <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/sqlite.html">http://www.sqlite.org/sqlite.html</a>. Additionally, we have provided very helpful hints for most of the problems; you should be able to use these as a starting point if you get stuck before looking up additional information online.
                </p>

                <h2>Part 1: Starting Off!</h2>
                <h3>20 points</h3>

                    <p>This part of the assignment builds off the exercises you completed in the lab. If you have not yet completed the first half of the lab, please do so before starting this assignment. The database and schema are described again below, but are the same from the lab.</p>

                    <p>
                        We have provided a database named <code>people.db</code> with the name, age, ID, and occupation of some Brown students and alumni.
                        Here is the schema: </p>
                        <pre>people_main(<strong>ID</strong> INTEGER, <strong>name</strong> TEXT, <strong>occupation</strong> TEXT, <strong>age</strong> INTEGER)
people_likes(<strong>ID1</strong> INTEGER, <strong>ID2</strong> INTEGER)
people_friends(<strong>ID1</strong> INTEGER, <strong>ID2</strong> INTEGER)</pre>

                    <p>In the <strong>people_main</strong> table, <strong>ID</strong> is a unique identifier for a particular student or alumni. <strong>name</strong>, <strong>occupation</strong> and <strong>age</strong> correspond to the person's first name, occupation and age.
                    <p>In the <strong>people_friends</strong> table, each (<strong>ID1</strong>, <strong>ID2</strong>) pair indicates that the particular person with <strong>ID1</strong> is friends with the person with <strong>ID2</strong> (and vice versa). The friendship is mutual, and if (<strong>ID1</strong>, <strong>ID2</strong>) is in the table, it is guaranteed that (<strong>ID2</strong>, <strong>ID1</strong>) exists in the table.</p>
                    <p>In the <strong>people_likes</strong> table, each (<strong>ID1</strong>, <strong>ID2</strong>) pair indicates that the student or alumni with <strong>ID1</strong> likes the person with <strong>ID2</strong>. The (<strong>ID1</strong>, <strong>ID2</strong>) pair in the table does not guarantee that the (<strong>ID2</strong>, <strong>ID1</strong>) pair also exists in the table.</p>

                    <p>
                      Your job is to write SQL queries for the data being requested:
                    </p>
                    <ol type="1">
                      <li>
                          (4 points) Write a SQL statement that returns the  <strong>name</strong> and number of people that like each person. Results should be ordered by count (descending), and then by name (A-Z). Save the query to <code>part1_problem1.sql</code>
                          <p>
                              Hint: Use a <code>LEFT JOIN</code>… the following website is quite useful: <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/a-visual-explanation-of-sql-joins/">http://blog.codinghorror.com/a-visual-explanation-of-sql-joins/</a>
                          </p>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                              (4 points) Write a SQL statement that returns the two <strong>occupations</strong> that have the lowest count of popular people. Consider popular people as people who are liked by at least one other person. Return the two occupations and the counts. Results should be ordered by <strong>occupation</strong> (A-Z). Save the query to <code>part1_problem2.sql</code>                          <p>
                              Hint: The <code>LIMIT</code> statement will come in handy!
                          </p>
                      </li>

                      <li>
                          (4 points) Write a SQL statement that returns the  <strong>name</strong> and  <strong>occupation</strong> of all people who have more than 3 friends. Results should be ordered by  <strong>name</strong> (A-Z). Save the query to <code>part1_problem3.sql</code>
                          <p>
                              Hint: You'll need to take a look at the <code>HAVING</code> function.
                          </p>
                      </li>

                      <li>
                          (4 points) Write a SQL statement that returns the distinct  <strong>name</strong> and <strong>age</strong> of all people who are liked by anyone younger than them. Results should be ordered by <strong>name</strong> (A-Z). Save the query to <code>part1_problem4.sql</code>
                          <p>
                              You can do this problem without using two <code>SELECT</code> statements, but doing so makes sure that all your answers are distinct. Also, future problems will require using two <code>SELECT</code> statements, so practicing here isn't a bad idea!
                          </p>
                      </li>

                      <li>
                          (4 points) Write a SQL statement to find pairs (A, B) such that person A likes person B, but A is not friends with B. The query should return 4 columns:  <strong>ID</strong> of person 1, <strong>name</strong> of person 1, <strong>ID</strong> of person 2 and <strong>name</strong> of person 2. Results should be ordered by <strong>ID1</strong> (ascending), then <strong>ID2</strong> (ascending). Save the query to <code>part1_problem5.sql</code>
                          <p>
                              Time to join stuff!
                          </p>
                      </li>
                  </ol>

            <h2>Part 2: Getting Harder!</h2>
            <h3>60 points</h3>
              <p>
                For this part of the assignment, you will be using the TMDB Movie Dataset, which has been exported to the <code>movies.db</code> database. The database
                schema is as follows:</p>
                <pre>movies(<strong>budget</strong> INTEGER, <strong>homepage</strong> TEXT, <strong>id</strong> INTEGER, <strong>original_language</strong> TEXT, <strong>original_title</strong> TEXT, <strong>overview</strong> TEXT, <strong>popularity</strong> REAL, <strong>release_date</strong> TEXT, <strong>revenue</strong> REAL, <strong>runtime</strong> INTEGER, <strong>status</strong> TEXT, <strong>tagline</strong> TEXT, <strong>title</strong> TEXT, <strong>vote_average</strong> REAL, <strong>vote_count</strong> INTEGER)
scores(<strong>review</strong> TEXT, <strong>min_score</strong> INTEGER, <strong>max_score</strong> INTEGER)</pre>

              <p>
                We encourage you to use the <code>WITH</code> operator, which lets you divide your query into separate queries. As an example, we can define a subquery and
                use it in another query as follows:
                <pre>WITH subquery AS (
SELECT
  original_title, vote_average
FROM
  movies
)

SELECT
  original_title
FROM
  subquery
);</pre>
              </p>

                <p>
                  <ol type="1">
                    <li>
                      (10 points) Write a SQL query to find the <strong>original_title</strong>, <strong>budget</strong> and  <strong>release_date</strong> of the movie "John Carter"
                      and append to that the movie  <strong>original_title</strong>,  <strong>budget</strong> and  <strong>release_date</strong> of the movie that was released
                      9 days after "John Carter" (This movie should also be a Disney movie!).
                      <p>
                        You can add days to a particular day
                        by using the <code>date</code> function.
                        For example, in order to add 3 days to to '2012-07-16', you can use <code>date('2012-07-16', '+3 days')</code>
                      </p>
                    </li>
                    <p>
                      Hint: The <code>UNION</code> statement should come in handy.
                    </p>
                    <li>
                      (10 points) Write a SQL query to count the number of movies that start with "The", end with a "2" or contain the word "shark".
                      Your query should be case insensitive and return one column with one entry. You should return a single value.
                    </li>
                    <p>
                      Hint: You may want to look into <code>CASE</code> statements and the <code>LIKE</code> operator.
                    </p>
                    <li>
                      (10 points) Write a SQL query to select the <strong>original_title</strong> of all movies and a column where there is a 1 if there exists another movie that has the
                      same vote average and the same runtime as that movie, and a 0 otherwise. Results should be ordered by <strong>original_title</strong> (A-Z).
                    </li>
                    <p>
                      Hint: You may want to look into the <code>EXISTS</code> operator. Additionally, think about possible edge cases.
                    <li>
                      (10 points) Write a SQL query that returns the <strong>original_title</strong>, <strong>vote_average</strong> and <strong>review</strong> of every movie. The reviews depends on the vote_average
                      as described described in the <code>scores</code> table. For example, movies with a vote average between 2 and 3.9 (inclusive) are reviewed as 'poor',
                      whereas movies with a vote average between 9 and 10 (inclusive) are reviewed as 'excellent'.

                      If a movie is reviewed as 'awful' or 'poor' then <strong>original_title</strong> should read 'do not watch'.
                      Results should be ordered by <strong>id</strong> (ascending).

                      For example, the output should have the following format:
                      <pre>
'Snow White'   | 8.7 | 'great'
'Toy Story'    | 9.3 | 'must see'
'do not watch' | 2.3 | 'poor'
</pre>
                    <p>
                      Hint: Look into the <code>BETWEEN</code> statement and how it can be used in a join.
                    </p>

                    <li>
                      (10 points) Write a SQL query that finds the <strong>original_title</strong>, <strong>release_date</strong> and <strong>revenue</strong>
                      of all the movies whose revenue exceeded the average revenue of all the movies released on the same day (including itself). Results should be ordered by <strong>release_date</strong> (ascending), and then <strong>revenue</strong> (descending).
                    </li>
                  </br>
                    <li>
                      <p>
                        (10 points) Write a SQL query that, <strong>for each original_language</strong> that has <strong>more than 2 movies </strong> , finds the number of movies that were reviewed as 'poor' and the number of movies that were reviewed as 'good'.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Like in the 4th question, you will need to look at the <code>scores</code> table to see what the review categories are and use the <strong>vote_average</strong> field of a movie to determine which review category it falls under. Your query should return 3 columns (<strong>original_language</strong>, <strong>num_poor</strong> which is the number of 'poor' movies for that language and <strong>num_good</strong> which should be the number of 'good' movies for the language. Your results should be <strong>ordered</strong> by number of 'good' movies (descending) and then number of 'poor' movies (ascending). Remember to only include languages that have more than 2 movies!
                      </p>
                    </li>

                  </ol>

              <strong>For the query below</strong>, explain why the given query might not be the most efficient way to accomplish the task. Write out an optimized version of the query in <code>writeup.txt</code>. Explain what steps you took to optimize it and why your version would be more efficient.

                  (6 points) The SQL query to optimize is as follows:
                </p>

                <pre>SELECT ID, name
      FROM school_athletes AS athletes
      WHERE school = 'Brown' and performance_score > (
        SELECT AVG(performance_score)
        FROM school_athletes
        WHERE team = athletes.team
      ); </pre>

        <li>
                <p>
                    (4 points) Consider two tables. Table A is very long with 1 billion rows and
                    5 columns. Table B is very wide with 1000 rows and 10,000 columns. If we
                    were to join the two tables and want to make sure the join is performant,
                    how should we best filter the tables? Assume that we can select
                    from each table and then join the results. Specifically, state the table
                    in which we should use WHERE heavily and the table in which we should be careful
                    about what values we use in our SELECT.
