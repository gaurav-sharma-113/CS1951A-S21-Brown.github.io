            <h1>Heavy_Rotation Analysis</h1>
        </div>
        <h1>Hypothesis</h1>
        <p>
            Our hypothesis is as follows: <i>particular song features that correspond to virality 
            in the United States will propagate to other countries; that is, viral song features 
            in the United States will be viral song features in other countries</i>.
        </p>

        <h1>Methods</h1>
        <p>
            We tested our hypothesis using a survival analysis, which predicts the likelihood that a 
            song will remain on the viral charts given some feature set. The intuition behind this is if
            particular features were found to be most statistically significant in the survival of all 
            viral songs for a given country, these features could be considered the set that corresponds 
            to song virality in the general sense. We back this assumption with the observation that, 
            given the amount of data we collected, we have a representative sample over many months 
            with which we can generalize about song virality. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Specifically, we chose the <a href="http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/cox-proportional-hazards-model">Cox proportional-hazards model</a>
            for our analysis. This model is a linear regression model which can assess simultaneously 
            the effect of several features on survival time. In our case, we define survival time as the 
            number of days a particular song stays on the viral chart for a given country. 
        </p>
        <p>
            We considered other tests, such as simple linear and logistic regression models. However, 
            we ultimately decided on a survival analysis in part because it would enable us to more 
            efficiently test our second hypothesis &mdash; a prediction of song virality on unseen data. 
            (This hypothesis is not tested in this deliverable.) We chose CoxPH as our particular survival 
            analysis model because we found it to be the standard model in all the literature 
            we read. Additionally, in the R stats package we used to implement the model, we discovered 
            that all available survival analysis tools were variations on CoxPH and ultimately boiled 
            down to this model under the hood. 
        </p>

        <h2>Success Metric</h2>
        <p>
            We define our success metric as the set of song features that are statistically significant in terms 
            of song survival for a given set of countries. If this set is identical (or very similar &mdash; 
            <i>i.e.</i> a set difference no greater than 1), we will consider our hypothesis that viral song 
            features are identical across countries to be proven. 
        </p>
        <p>
            We chose this metric because of the intuition described above: if a set of songs with similar features 
            survive for about the same amount of time on charts across countries, the features representing those 
            songs indicate virality across countries. 
        </p>

        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>
            The only challenge we faced in conducting this analysis was dealing with 'viral gaps'. We encountered
            a very small number of cases where, for example, Song A was on a chart for the months of January and March,
            but not February. Therefore, the song was technically viral for two different time periods. However, 
            because we were considering such a long time period, we conducted our analysis on the total number of days
            a song was on the viral charts, even if they were not consecutive. While we recognize this is a major 
            assumption, we encountered no cases in practice where our analysis was impacted by it. 
        </p>

        <h1>Results</h1>
        <h2>Visualized Survival Trends and Coefficients per Country</h2>
        <h3>How to read these charts</h3>
        <p>
            Each row contains a CoxPH summary table (on the left) and a survival chart (on the right). The summary table 
            gives, for each song feature, the survival coefficient of that feature and the p-value for that survival coefficient. 
            The statistically significant features for song survival in that country are marked with asterisks &mdash; more 
            asterisks means more statistically significant. For purposes of our analysis, we considered features with 3 asterisks.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Kaplan-Meier chart gives the probability <i>y</i> that a song will remain on the chart for <i>x</i> days, 
            broken out by song feature. Feature lines which appear "lower" on the curve, then,
            contribute to faster disappearance from the charts. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The features corresponding to each number on the Kaplan-Meier charts are as follows: <br>
            0: valence<br>
            1: acousticness<br>
            2: danceability<br>
            3: energy<br>
            4: instrumentalness<br>
            5: speechiness<br>
            6: tempo<br>

        <h2>Discussion</h2>
        <p>
            Based particularly on the statistical significance table for each song feature for each country, we must 
            conclude that viral song features vary quite a bit between countries. For this reason, we must
            deny our hypothesis. We are satisfied with the accuracy of this conclusion, given the amount of data 
            on which it was based. 
        </p>
        <p>
            We chose to use Kaplan-Meier curves to visualize our result because we felt it best highlighted 
            <i>at what rate</i>, and not just <i>how much</i>, a feature affected virality. We could have used 
            bar charts, for example, to show the "weight" each feature placed on a song's survival for a given 
            country, but this was only tangentially relevant to our hypothesis. Additionally, using a bar chart 
            would have shown which features were more relevant to a song's survival than others, but not the rate 
            at which a song died off the charts as a result of one feature over another. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Much like how we provided an explanation of these summaries and charts in this analysis report, we 
            will do the same for the final poster. 
        </p>
        <p>
            It may appear, based on Fig. 6, that all viral songs share the same general feature set. This 
            could be evidenced by the fact that certain features have very "short" boxes and error bars, 
            indicating that these features are important in a viral song's survival.
            However, we cannot conclude from this that countries share the same viral sets. This is because
            the chart was created by aggregating all songs across all countries for the time period in question. 
            Thus, it is clear that some features (such as danceability and instrumentalness) are common across all countries. However, 
            the variability in other features' p-values indicates we cannot conclude these features are statistically
            significant in a song's survival. Instead, when the significant feature sets of various countries 
            are considered individually, we see that they are not in fact the same.
        </p>
        <p>
            When we began this project, we were concerned that we would not have enough granularity in our data to 
            draw good conclusions about viral feature sets &mdash; that is, we thought that the same specific songs 
            (not just the same specific features) would appear on every country's charts and confound our analysis. 
            However, we found in practice that while the same song <i>titles</i> often appeared together on all 
            countries' charts, the <i>length of time</i> that they remained on the charts varied. Thus, our use of survival 
            analysis allowed us to determine the features important for a song to become viral in a particular country despite
            the fact that similar songs appeared in those countries. 
        </p>

        <h1>Future Directions</h1>
        <p>
            Next, we will create a predictive model to anticipate how viral a song will become in a particular country 
            given its features. We will backtest this model on unseen historical data to demonstrate its effectiveness,
            and use it on just-released songs to see whether or not those songs will become viral.
