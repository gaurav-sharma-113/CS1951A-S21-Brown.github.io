A Dance with Dragons was a long time coming but the wait was worth it.About half of the main characters were missing from A Feast for Crows, so I thought that Dance would show the same period of time from different viewpoints instead of advancing the story. This is not the case.About 1/4th of Dance overlaps with the previous novel. After that the overall plot advances and takes some interesting turns. Characters absent from Feast such as Jon Snow and Tyrion tell the majority of Dance, but Jaime, Arya, and others also have a few chapters.Martin has not dropped the ball. A Dance with Dragons is just as good as Game of Thrones, and even more fun to read."

4,3.4,0.9932,2014,02-20,5748700,I-green,,USD 25.00-40.00,Stephen F Austin,South,12,"I've read two other previous books by Hemingway. Feel free to read those reviews as well. In his best piece, Old Man and the Sea, Hemingway describes a man's courage and conviction in a mini-epic struggle between and elderly man and the greatest catch of his life (a giant marlin). In another book, The Sun also Rises, Hemingway paints a very rich and colorful portraitt of Spain and Pamplona that I could not sum up in a few sentences. Both books create a vivid picture almost unequaled in literature.This book, however, does nothing of the sort. Excluding a side story that concerns the massacre of a town of locals, it is repetitive, boring, and provides little insight. The majority of this 450 page book takes place in one cave and provides very little substance. Personally, no picture was painted for me, no human character was exposed, and no real lasting meaning came from this book.I grew tired of the cave, tired of the speculation about killing the Guerilla leader Pablo, and bored of the lightweight, unreal romance. An editor could have spliced away pages 200-400, and the book would have not missed a beat.If you're a casual reader like myself, stick with other Hemingway works."

It really added to the book and really tied the story together for me. It was very dramatic for me to see how this once active and interesting man was effected by the years, and what age does to a person. It made me think how we cast aside many of our elderly friends and folks not paying attention to their stories. Especially key when thinking alone about Jacob's past. I have a great love and respect for elephants and at many times i was so angered in the story and could feel the emotions that Jacob was experiencing. It was such a strong event that occurred with Rosie, and without giving the story away was vindicating. Really don't want to watch the movie now as afraid would not live up to how i imagined everything or if they changed the story too much."

Lightbringer is bright, but without warmth. Is Dany some sort of savior, making Stannis the tricksy, oblivious antichrist? He means well. Is his red preistess lady aware, or are her fires decieving her? Will the unending summer come? Will all the starks be reunited, living and dead? The saga is so bleak and unpredictable. Will we have the traditional happy fantasy ending, or will the game continue, generation after generation, as the gods, old and new, watch with indifference, only half-ass intervening(if they intervene at all) Alas, I do not know..As usual it was somewhat tedious and the characters were hard to keep track of, but oh, well."
6,3.72,0.9952,1995,03-02,2066700,Juice Press,New York,,Georgetown,Southeast,6,"I am just aghast at the number of non-five-star ratings this book has received. The answer probably likes in the sophistication of the particular reviewers who are underrating this masterpiece. I don't want to make this sound arrogant or patronizing, but the great thing about the Internet (and Amazon reviewing) is that anyone can review, while the awful thing about the Internet is that anyone can review. I'm not sure what else one could want out of a Sci-fi novel than what you find here. My guess is that those who dislike it tend to prefer space opera or pure adventure books. But if you have any capacity to read good literature this novel will almost undoubtedly knock your socks off.RED MARS has been almost universally praised by Sci-fi writers and academics as one of the finest hard science Sci-fi novels in recent decades. Partly as a result of the influence of Philip K. Dick (my favorite Sci-fi writer, but someone who was almost completely uninterested in the ""science"" in Sci-fi but instead focused on metaphysical dilemmas), STAR TREK, and STAR WARS, Sci-fi has been less and less focused on science in the past few decades and instead has been more concerned with exploring questions like ""what is real?"" or adventure stories. Time was when the most denigrated form of Sci-fi was the space opera. Robinson's Mars Trilogy is the triumphant return of hard science in novelistic form. But RED MARS is far more than that. It is as political as it is scientific. I can imagine that a few of the people giving the novel low marks are troubled by Robinson's politics, which are further to the left than any prominent politician in America today. It isn't an accident that many Marxist writers, including Fredric Jameson, who Robinson thanks in the Acknowledgments, love Robinson's dystopian take on role of capitalism in forming the world we live in, either on earth (as in his Pacific trilogy) or on new worlds (as here in the Mars books). If you are a big fan of an unbridled free market capitalism (which by its very nature is utopian, in that it continually describes a world that doesn't exist, but insists could if only we would free the market from all political and social restraint) then this isn't a novel that will warm the laissez-faire cockles of your heart. This is capitalism as rapacious, inhuman, and imperialistic.I find the epic sweep of Robinson's vision to be almost overwhelming. He balances almost perfectly scientific, political, social, and narrative concerns. His characters are both many and richly drawn. His Mars exists in a way that only rarely do Sci-fi writers make possible. I can't point to many writers who have made their imaginary world so tangible and believable. I don't have the scientific expertise to address the plausibility of the many terraforming and climate altering techniques and tactics addressed in the novels, but I never found anything in the book to be absurd or silly.I loved the various components making up this book. And the characters are more developed and vivid than in most Sci-fi novels. While John Boone never really emerged for me as a believable character, many of the others like Frank, Maya, Nadia, the irrepressible Arkady, Ann, Sax, and many others did. Thanks to gene therapy that helps extend life by renewing the genetic structure of the body, many, though not all, of these characters make it into GREEN MARS or even into BLUE MARS. The trilogy itself extends over several decades. I can recommend few works of fiction as highly as I recommend this. But if you are looking for a great yarn rather than a great novel, look elsewhere. This probably isn't for you. But if you are instead looking for a truly great novel, for a trilogy that might represent the apex of Sci-fi writing of the past twenty years, do yourself a favor and read not just RED MARS, but the two other novels in the trilogy as well."

The quality of O'Brian's writing is as good as ever, with wonderful dialogue and descriptions. O'Brian does move the development of his main characters Aubrey and Maturin forward; Aubrey has mellowed and aged a little and now has the joys and burdens of having a wife and kids. It seems to me from this book that O'Brian did not intend for this series to continue on for nearly as many volumes as it did. For example, the Mauritius Campaign took place in 1810, only a few years before the end of the Napoleonic Wars. The previous book, HMS Suprise, seems to have taken place approximately five years before; a lot of prime war years were wasted. This book develops some interesting characters, particularly Captain Clonfert. The problem with this book is that a lot of time is taken up with our heros sailing here and there without much exciting happening. The ending is somewhat suspenseful, but not as much so as the previous three books. All in all, it is still a very good book but the series loses just a little of its freshness and originality."

Her words make the often seedy yet oh-so-fascinating world behind the scenes of a legendary circus train seem so real, so here and now. The central figure of Jacob Jankowski is so well written. I am especially taken with the depiction of life in a nursing home with the body of a 93-year-old and the wit and mind of a much much younger man. It gave me a whole new perspective on how sad and depressing life must be like in an institution like that and will make me spend more time getting to know those who find their homes in such a place. But what struck me most was when I read the Afterward in which Ms. Gruen explained the motivation for writing this novel and the incredibly detailed research that she found herself doing just to put pen to paper. Not only is she so very gifted with the ease of writing, but she is very committed to the realism of details. Incredible! She took some really fascinating true stories from some of this country's most storied circuses and rolled them all into one incredible journey. I highly recommed this book to everyone I meet and I will be looking for more of her works to inspire and inform. Do yourself a favor and pick up this book today."

That's my general rule after all. And I was sorely disappointed.In this historical novel, Jacob Jankowski, the protagonist, has left Vetrinary school at Cornell after suffering the loss of his parents, who have died in a tragic car accident. He learns fairly quickly that his father, also a vet, was heavily in debt and actually died owing money. So Jacob leaves school and his home and literally joins the circus. He travels cross country with the circus, acting as the show's vetrinarian and working under August, the head trainer and Uncle Al, the show's ringleader. August is an interesting man, alternately charming and brutal. He's also married to the beautiful Marlena, a performer, that Jacob forms a special bond with. This novel is about Jacob's relationship with Marlena, with the new elephant, Rosie and with Uncle Al.There are definitely several themes that are prevalent in this novel, which are super easy to pick out. Water is for cleansing, for instance and the train tracks are for choosing a life path.I was not impressed by this book at all. The themes were easy to spot and the ending was just as easy to spot. The characters were shallow and one dimensional and I found myself annoyed with them more often than I was intrigued by them. I just didn't really like it - I kept expecting it to get better and it didn't. It was a complete and utter failure."

Following two families, this historic fiction offers insights into WWII that no textbook could. It opens in early 1939 and closes with Pearl Harbor, describing events in London, Europe, Washington and the Pacific. The book includes an enormous amount of factual data on actual events and individuals who played a significant role during the period. Additionally, it very effectively employs the device of reports written by a fictitious German general, to provide the German perspective on the war effort there. All in all an excellent book that should be required reading for anyone that feels they know too little about the period. And the sequel, War and Remembrance (which I am now reading) is an excellent follow up, continuing to track the characters throughout the remainder of the war."

7,3.12,0.9932,1994,04-20,3468100,The Cheesecake Factory,Brea,,Wisconsin Green Bay,West,12,"..so says one of the protagonists near the end of the book. I know exactly how he feels.'Circus' is a good example of Maclean's late-career decline. His early tales were tightly-plotted and exciting, with plenty of action, and interesting (if not exactly original) characters. In contrast, apart from a mildly interesting plot, this book is loose and lazily written, almost as if Maclean couldn't really be bothered.The characters are little more than two-dimensional cut-outs: Bruno is the typical introverted loner hero with a tragic past, who nevertheless seems an expert at nearly everything. Maria Hopkins is an utterly clueless 'heroine' whom we cannot for a second believe is a CIA operative. And these are two of the most well-drawn characters! What about Manuelo, Roebuck and Kan Dahn? We know what motivates Bruno to act as he does, but what's their motivation? Or Harper's? Or, for that matter, Van Diemen's? We're never given any insight into what drives these characters; there's lots of shrugging of shoulders and ""we may never know why he did what he did..."". It reads like a cop-out.The writing, dialogue and descriptive passages are leaden and often lazy. For example, there is the thriller cliche of the bad guys allowing the heroes to progress so far because they plan to trap them at the very end. This does nothing except rob the book of any action or suspense, and of course our heroes easily predict the trap and dispose of the villians without breaking a sweat. The romance between Bruno and Maria is corny even by thriller standards. And while a couple of characters are unexpectedly dispatched, we never feel any real threat directed at Bruno. He's portrayed as so skilled at everything that we never believe there's a situation he can't get out of.The book's only real good point is that the anti-matter plot is interesting, and the way in which the CIA plan to use Bruno is quite novel. It's clear Maclean had a few good ideas here. What a shame he couldn't make something better out of them."

The twelve years of research Mr. Wouk put into this book is a historical fiction lover's dream. He somehow manages to take a lot of dry information and turn it into fascinating, can't put down, reading. I came away from this book with a better and clearer understanding of WW2 than I have ever had before.The Henry family are the main characters of the story, with Captain Victor ""Pug"" Henry, a Naval Officer, as the head of it. None of the characters are really all that well fleshed out, there is just way to much going on in this story for there to be time to go too deep, but it all seems to work to make a very enjoyable and fascinating story that is hard to put down.This is definitely a ""can't put down"" book but I actually found myself taking my time to read it and savor it because I didn't want it to come to an end. This is a huge book (1056 pages) but I didn't find any part of it that dragged at all. I am so happy there is a sequel. Even after reading this 1000 plus page book I am ready to dive right into the second equally large book about the Henry family and the continuation of WW2.This is one of those special rare books that only comes along once in a long while...books you wish you could read again for the first time."

It is nice how it all comes together in the end but I think it could have done so with less pages.

It suffers from a predictable plot, cardboard characters and formaldehyde dialogue, and its success is obviously due to the imprimatur of the Oracle Oprah (and you will notice that nearly all the positive reviews here are from the distaff side), but it does have one salient virtue. It gets all the facts right.I become enraged, when reading a novel, if I notice that the author was too lazy to research (look up) what he's writing about. In detective stories such errors are usually about guns; in other novels inaccuracies are often about cars or planes. But Ms. Gruen, to her everlasting credit, has all the arcane details of the bygone circus life perfectly accurate. Because of this, I'm eager to forgive the book's other shortcomings.Now, obviously Sara Gruen did not work in a circus in the 1930s. She has never worked in a circus. She obviously learned all the arcane details of circus lore from reading other, better books. One such book isCircus Paradeby the hobo writer Jim Tully.Circus Paradeis ten times the book that this one is, and the original story of the elephant who got revenge on his mean trainer can be found in it."

The girl's past soon comes back to haunt her however as the pimps she escaped from find her. Kelly is sent reeling with another death of someone close to him.

American POWs have been found there. Kelly is put in charge of designing a mission, training the men and leading them to rescue the prisoners.Without Remorse wasn't one of my favorite Clancy books. The Vietnam POW story line isn't heavy enough and the final raid is anticlimactic. The story line with the girl and the drug gang takes up the bulk of the book and while it's interesting to a point, it also goes on too long. I got bored during much of that plot.

5,3.24,0.9972,2008,07-01,17144900,Bikeway,Wappingersfalls,,Xavier,West,3,"...so I started reading this book. About a third of the way through my doctor prescribed clonazepam and I no longer needed the book. Honestly, I can't see how anyone could get through this book without already suffering from insomnia as badly as I was. It is the most boring book I have ever read and I could only force myself because it was the middle of the night, there was nothing to do, and I had mistakenly bought it.I am a fan of hard science fiction, and that is what this book purports to be. But hard-SF needs to be speculative and push boundaries. This doesn't. An analogy might explain - in the 19th century cantilever bridge building might have been seen as cutting edge technology. Imagine someone writing cantilever bridge fiction. The science aspect of it would be completely uninteresting. It would be a story about the politics and economics of getting the bridge built. Well this book is about that interesting. It's a collection of uninteresting unealistic characters involved in endless contrived office politics trying to get some uninteresting science and engineering done. It just so happens that it's on Mars but most of it is far less interesting than bridge building. I'm not exaggerating. We have to read about how concrete foundations were laid, how bricks were manufactured and have to suffer detailed geological surveys of the areas the characters visit.If your preferred genre is boring books try ""Report on Probability A"" by Aldiss. I used to think it was the most boring book on earth but at least it was short and turned boredom into an art form worth rereading. Read Mars is boredom without purpose. Your time would be better spent actualy reading some real science about Mars.Addendum, Jan 1994Well I did eventually finish this book even tyhough I thought I'd given up. Some things do happen later in the book. The characters remain supremely uninteresting and there are still no original ideas. But there is some entertaining large scale destruction if you like that sort of thing. So I bumped the rating up to 2 stars."

This book just grabbed me and I had to read it until I finished it. The trademark Hemingway style of silence is present here. The landscape and environment are as much a part of the story as the characters. It took getting used to pages of describing the landscape so deeply, but once I went along for the ride I enjoyed the novel immensely. The plot seems conventional, that's fine for me."

6,3.05,0.9986,1990,01-22,7428500,Cooking With Nrg,Norwalk,$,Duke,Championship,3,"Robert Jordan, an American in at least the third generation, and a teacher of Spanish from Montana, goes to fight in the Spanish Civil War. His motives are never discussed, as are not the theater of or the reasons for the war. The novel is rather about several people who, in the course of a few days, are helping Robert Jordan complete his mission: to blow up a bridge.The novel's tall order - being ""involved in Mankinde"" to the extent of fighting thy neighbor's civil wars - is echoed in the story's close engagement with each character. Here is the natural-born killer Pablo, his no-nonsense and wise Gypsy wife Pilar, the beautiful young girl Maria who is carrying much pain, the good old rock of a man Anselmo, who fights to win this war, but who in his bones knows that thou shalt not kill.Robert Jordan is singled out to have both the first and last name. All the other foreigners go by their last names and the Spaniards - by their first ones. Besides embodying the foreign engagement in the Spanish affair, Robert Jordan also brings a distinctly human element into the war zone: the lonely human name among the nomes de guerre of general Golzs and partisan Anselmos.The book is written as if translated from Spanish. The language is a bit choppy, many expressions read like Spanish idioms translated verbatim, some phrases are left in Spanish. This adds to the feeling that one is in a foreign setting. As it often happens in Hemingway's novels, much working of the human spirit is revealed through this simple language."

This book takes place at the same time as book 4 (A Feast For Crows). While Feast for Crows focused mainly on events in Westeros, this book was supposed to focus on Daenerys in Essos and those north of the wall. Yet Bran only gets 3 chapters? Bran hasn't had a very interesting storyline (at least compared to some of the other POVs) but the 3rd Bran chapter here gets interesting and leaves you with many questions that won't get answered until Winds of Winter (which George RR Martin prob won't release until 2015).The Daenerys chapters seemed stagnant to me once she stopped traveling around and it drove me nuts trying to keep track of characters with crazy names like Hizdahr zo Loraq, Reznak mo Reznak, and Skahaz mo Kandaq. The most interesting chapters taking place in Essos weren't even Daenerys chapters, but chapters of those converging on Mereen.I don't want to sound too critical because this is still a very good book. And the worst of ASOIAF is still better than most fantasy books out there. I'm just a harsh judge and I have to rate this book in relation to the other 4 books of the series. That being said I loved the events that went down in Winterfell and the Erie. I liked finally seeing dragons in action. You can see the growth in characters like Sansa and Arya, and the decline of characters like Cersei. And with all the major gut wrenching or crazy events of the previous books (Beheading of Ned, Red Wedding, Joffreys Wedding, etc) I was floored with the &#34;gut wrenching event&#34; in this book. This one hit me harder than all the others. No spoilers though, gotta read it to find out!"

I would have never thought a story set in the 30's about a 20year old man who runs away and joins the circus would have kept me interested. This book did. It was nice to get an understanding about how life would have been back then for Circus-folk. I took for granted for many years how a show is produced. It was so descriptive that I could hear the circus music playing.There was a few boring spots, but when the book picks up the tempo, it makes up for the few boring parts. Also I didn't like how the prolog made it seem like Marlena murdered August, when it turns out to be Rosie the Elephant. That was the books Far-fetched moment. The Kindle Version was for some reason, hard to read. They would have 1 word a page. Not sure why. The upcoming movie looks like good. I don't see Reese Whiterspoon as Marlena since of the age difference, but I'm sure it will be a great movie."

What I found was a reasonably interesting story that was not terribly well told: for such a graphic topic, the prose was not very visual and often skimmed surfaces of moments that could have been captured with much more attention to detail.I would not recommend this book.

To my mind, a good novel has unexpected twists and surprises .. and this book carried one beautiful surprise all the way through.This book stirred in me an affection for elephants that I hadn't felt since childhood.

I cried a few times as I read them.With that said, I think it is beautiful and honorable for these elephants to be acknowledged and their names remembered as their stories are further shared with the world.The details in the book regarding the workers and the environment of the circus were accurate and well portrayed.I felt a connection with all of the characters not just their Marlena and Jacob."

This book was a mixed bag.In the first part of the book, terrible things happened to both people and animals.In the latter part of the book, the angels practically came down to sing. Everything good that could happen, did! I'm not opposed to that. It just seemed a bit much. Too simplisic. Even the ultimate solution for old Jacob was just strangely perfect and therefore hard to believe.A logical question that bugged me about the plot was why did Uncle Al not get rid of the schizophrenic August? And how in the world did August get to be in charge of the animals in the first place? He wasn't good with them. Jacob or the other Polish worker would have been much more effective training Rosie. If Uncle Al had ditched August, the inflammatory situation between him, Marlena, and Jacob would have been defused.When Jacob was scooping up Rosie and the liberty horses, I was silently pleading 'Don't forget BoBo.' And he didn't. Like I said, just too good to be true."

Im glad I didn't have to wait six years for this one like some people did. Now that I read it, I understand why many were disappointed. Its rather a bloated book. For one thing there is way too much description of family shields, clothing worn, and Westeros history - descriptions that if you read the previous four books, you already know for the most part. Way too much time was spent describing the various difficulties in traveling; yes, we get it, people get seasick a lot. Is it necessary to describe it each time it happens? The sections that take place off Westeros included way too many characters to keep track of. I found myself bored often and skimmed most of these sections (tho the part where Dany finally gets to fly was breathtaking). I also had trouble with the timeline - just how much time has passed here, and just how old are some of these leaders? Are Dany and Jon really only 15 or so? No wonder things are so screwed up. I did enjoy reading about Bran and Arya, but then they were sort of dropped and never heard of again. I loved that Cersei finally gets whats been coming to her for a long time, and loved Tyrion, as always. But he sorely needed an editor in this book, more so than any of his other books in the series. If it had been tighter narrative, this easily could have been a 4 star.That all being said - this was another page turner. I was hooked from the beginning, and while there were some sections I skimmed through, the story certainly kept my attention. As usual, he is a genius in characer development, and in showing the different facets of each character. I also appreciated of the new maps, but I wished he had made a character list in abc order, instead of by families, for easy reference. Hoping the next book happens soon, with tying up"

I don't know that I like it any better or any worse than A Feast for Crows, which was my least-favourite book of the series thus far. And I was, if not expecting, at least hoping to like this one a lot better, because I so many more of my favourite characters were in this one. And there were certainly parts I enjoyed a lot. But there were a lot of parts that frustrated me, a lot of parts that bored me, and a lot of parts that felt completely extraneous. It's definitely in need of judicious editing. I sort of get the feeling that his editors, so happy to have him finally declare it finished, didn't actually spend much time editing before sending it to print. Apart from a lot of unnecessary repetition and a lot of extraneous material, I also found five typos.So, overall -- I'm giving this 3.5 because I just sort of don't know what to do with it. There were quite a few moments that genuinely excited me. But there were a lot of things that frustrated me, that needed editing, or that should've been held off till the next book. And there are so many things left unanswered, so many arcs that began in this book or in Feast that have yet to see any kind of fulfillment whatsoever...

Water for Elephants is one of those wonderful novels that has an interesting setting, but it doesn't let the setting take over the story. It is a novel about the people in that place, and the people of Benzini's circus took over my mind and stay with me still.Jacob begins Water for Elephants alone. Orphaned by his immigrant parents, he is weeks away from his Cornell graduation, but he simply cannot return to the life he has known. He jumps aboard a moving train-the train carrying the Benzini circus to its next production. No one on the circus cares that Jacob didn't finish his final exams. The diploma, he is told, ""is just a piece of paper, and nobody here gives a damn about that. You're on a show now. The rules are different.""In fact, the circus seems to have no rules at all. Jacob somehow finds other kind souls among the misfits, and these people work together to protect themselves and the animals. The villians-Uncle Al and August-are well described and three-dimensional. You understand why they behave the way they do. These villians are not cookie-cutter images, and their real-world sensibilities make them even more frightening."

I can understand anyone with a passion for the circus or the 1930's getting excited about it but for the average reader it has nothing special to offer so I am shocked by the positive attention and time on the best sellers list this book has generated. Without giving any spoilers away let me say the book is very cliched and predictable and the leading human characters are all undeveloped and quite stereotyped. The animals are perhaps given a little more rounded personalities. The circus portion of the story ends in a fantastic and unbelievable manner and the other story in which our hero is now an old man in a nursing home ends in just as unlikely manner. Others have commented on the great cover and I wonder if that is responsible for the surprising success of this book. THE CIRCUS IN WINTER by Cathy Day which came out a couple of years ago is a much better written book and is just as well researched with a very similar setting.

I had high expectations because of the press from the movie and from the many positive reviews. Unfortunately, few of my expectations were met.What I Like About This Book:It's the Circus. I love the sideshow era and just to read a book that was set in a Circus was entertaining.Easy read. Ending was fun, even if it was a little too neat.What I Did Not Like About This Book:Poor character development, especially the villains. It was obvious everyone hated August and Uncle Al, but not obvious why. Even when we finally see August at his worst, its too little too late. In fact, August loses his mind because he thinks his wife is sleeping with Jake, something that is not quite true yet, but definitely headed that direction. His actions are unjustified, but his anger seems entirely justified - his wife is already having an emotional affair with another man, and has already kissed him. The villains were never developed and because of that, the story was not nearly as engaging or suspenseful as it could have been. The hero also makes some odd decisions that don't match up with his character, like letting August beat the animals.True Love? Nope. Love story seemed contrived. Falls in love at first sight.Rosie the elephant was poorly developed as a character. Almost a background piece in the story.I really can't pinpoint exactly what it was about this book that didn't work, but it definitely didn't. The characters were poorly developed, the love interest and suspense contrived, and it was hard to care a lot about the elephant because we never really got to know her.

This series has become akin to a movie that I heard was good, and started off good, but turned out to be bad, but I just keep watching either because I expect it to get better, or I have already invested so much time in it.I cannot understand why this would merit 5 stars from anyone other than those making money off of it. To me 5 stars makes it one of the all time best books I have ever read, one that I will reread again and again because it is so entertaining, one that I think fondly of, or causes me to think in new ways, or inspires me to change my life. How can this book be any of those things to anyone, even to the author?At most I would think it should get 3 stars, but that would only be due to it being part of a larger series. By itself it should get one star, if that.The only redeeming feature of the book is the cliffhanger at the end, but if that situation turns out bad (character dies) then my interest in this series as a whole will die along with him."

O'Brian does not disappoint as Captain Aubrey and Stephen Maturin do battle against the French in the Indian Ocean. Here the plot turns on psychological profiles. Aubrey commands a squadron of ships, and each captain is a different study: Pym steady but unimaginative; Clonfert vainglorious, insecure, and unpredictable; Corbett daring but brutal; and Colonel Keating steady and brave. And there are Aubrey and Maturin, separately and together, musing upon the different elements in each of the captain's characters. As the action progresses, each captain is led into crisis, and each benefits and suffers by his particular choices.In some respects ""The Mauritius Command"", at 348 pages in the Norton edition, may be too short. Clonfert is the captain we come to know best, the others are not as fully drawn because we spend no time aboard their ships. Also, the final assault on Mauritius is reduced to a few throw-away lines on the last page, as though O'Brian turned away from the book, unfinished, and simply chose not to write the last two chapters. The book is a good one, O'Brian's intentions are clear. The captains' stark choices are grounded more in their personalities than the circumstances of the struggle. Their fates are sealed long before they join Aubrey in the Indian Ocean. ""The Mauritius Command"" is a thrilling psychological study."

Wouk is a skilled story teller, and the reader quickly learns to like and to care about the fate of Wouk's characters. Also, Wouk portrays a vision of America appealing to Americans: they enter war reluctantly, but once in, they fight the good war and fight it well. Although Wouk knows too much about the military to abandon all cynicism, he portrays military men as generally competent, committed, and patriotic.The appeal of the novel is also its limitation. This is not a meditation on the human condition like Tolstoy's ""War and Peace."" Also, Wouk uses his characters to tell the whole story of the lead up to World War II. He is sufficiently skilled to pull it off, but he spreads his characters a bit thin in the process.I recommend the book as highly entertaining. Despite its length, it reads fast."

Unsuccessful and hapless in his domestic life, he immediately jumps at the chance to leave England and take over a new command. Off the coast of Africa, Jack is promoted to commodore, putting him in command not just of his own ship but of a small fleet. In the course of the book, Jack stretches his abilities to the fullest as the British vie with the French for possession of several small islands crucial to controlling the India trade.Of course, Dr. Stephen Maturin is on hand too. His facets as doctor, naturalist, and spy all come into play in the course of the novel. The previous novel, H.M.S. Surprise, involved incredible physical suffering, loss, and rejection for Stephen so it was nice to see him get a break in this installment. However, Stephen is still haunted by what has happened to him. A dark current runs through him that no doubt will resurface in future books.The overriding issue explored in this novel is leadership and what it means to be a good leader. Jack has to deal with two very different captains serving under him, one of whom is a silly and vain man who is kind and familiar with his men and thus beloved by them. The other is a brave commander who exercises brutal tyranny with those under his rule. The weaknesses of both men lead to very different disasters.In spite of the battles and some serious turns of event, The Mauritius Command involves more action and comedy and less angst than H.M.S. Surprise, making it a lighter read."
6,3.33,0.9958,1993,10-15,9871800,Di Lac Vegetarian Restaurant,San Jose,,Coastal Carolina,West,16,"Sometimes, a reader's expectations can greatly influence how she or he views a book. With a name like ""Water for Elephants"", and a historical background as interesting as the Great Depression, I had expected to read a book about the difficulties of the circus life and how the historical backdrop influenced these characters' lives. What I got instead was a sentimental love story dressed in the glitz of a historical novel, a slightly better-written version of a Nicholas Sparks novel.At the start of the book, the circus has just come to town; and that effectively got our querulous 93-year-old narrator to start reminiscing about the good old days when he used to travel with the Benzini Brother's Most Spectacular Show on Earth as a veterinarian. As it turned out, 23-year-old Jacob Jankowski was one exam away from getting his veterinarian's degree from Cornell when both of his parents were killed in an automobile accident. After having handled all of his parents' affairs, and after having found out that he's now virtually penniless, the grief-stricken young man walked out of his class room and hopped on the first train that crossed his path, a train that turned out to be the circus train owned by a ruthless circus owner, Big Al. For the next 3 1/2 months, Jacob travelled with the circus as a veterinarian, taking care of the animals in the manegerie during the day and traveling from city to city by night. It was also during this time that he met Marlena, the cricus performer who turned out to be the love of his life, and her cruel but charismatic husband, August. The three soon developed the kind of complicated relationship that any romance reader worth his/her salt will know how it's going to turn out.The greatest strenght of this book definitely lies in the author's portrayl of circus life as they were in the early 1930's. With Big Al, August, and Walter the midget - the author has assembled a memorable cast of secondary characters that the readers will either love to hate or root for. Walter, in particular, turns out to be a character with much more depth than initially meets the eye, and how his relationship with Jacob evolved and developed was one of the highlights of the book. Equally interesting was Jacob's interactions with Rosie, a mischievous elephant that ended up being the catalyst for a key event that will change Jacob's life. I've never been a fan of the circus, but reading about Rosie's antics made me want to grab a handful of peanuts and head to the zoo.Regrettably, our main protagonists in the featured love story aren't nearly as interesting as the secondary or even the animal characters in the book. Jacob, in particular, has about as much personality as a gnat. Throughout the book, he was grouchy as a 93-year-old, and whiny and ineffectual as a 23-year-old. Some of the atrocities committed against the members of the circus - all in the name of survival and profit - is heartbreaking. And yet, other than to rant and spend time sulking and moping around in his stockcart, Jacob was useless when it comes to helping his friends or even taking fate into his own hands. Ultimately, his life turned out the way he wanted it to not because of any initiative on his part, but pure luck. Since the book was told in first person from Jacob's point of view, the character of Marlena was even more under-developed than Jacob. All we know is that she's this beautiful girl in pink sequin that caught Jacob's eye the day he joined the circus and from then on he was lost. There certainly wasn't enough interaction between the two to make their romance remotely convincing. And for a book whose central theme is the great forbidden romance between two people who met at the wrong time, this is a great failure.So, in summation, if you are expecting to read a meaty historical that provides insight to what the circus life was like back during the 1930's, skip the book. If you are a fan of Nicholas Sparks and looking for a sentimental love story to tide you over until his next publication, this may just be your cup of tea."

However, the writing was simple and flat, the characters lacked depth or conviction and the ending was a huge let down.

Over and over, he continued to behave like a helpless child while this animal was brutalized. Time and again, he is either incredibly violent or he is impotent and seemingly defenseless. In the end, each conflict is suddently and hastily resolved with little authenticity. What a shame as this could have been a deeply moving and engaging story."

R. James' classic story, ""Casting the Runes."" The plot is pretty well identical to Tourneur's creepy masterpiece, only updated and relocated from England to the hills of West Virginia.Long-distance trucker Josh Spiller finds himself off the beaten track in an oddly affluent little mountain town called Furnace, where a woman cold-bloodedly pushes an infant in its stroller in front of his eighteen-wheeler. The local constabulary are in no doubt it was an accident, but they don't believe his story about the woman pushing the baby - Spiller's description of her is that of their town benefactoress and councillor, Nelly McFarlane.Stymied, Spiller leaves town and picks up a teenaged girl hitchhiker named Griffin, who is anxious to leave Furnace because she considers it a bad place, though she won't say precisely why. Soon, Spiller notices diabolical phenomena following him around - sulfurous smells, evil apparitions, claw marks in his truck - and the discovery of an unidentified parchment in his wallet is fingered by Griffin as the cause. Seems Furnace's financial prosperity is attached to a little old-fashioned witchcraft, and the runic parchment in Spiller's possession is a supernatural tracking device for a demonic assassin due to dismember Spiller before daybreak - that is, unless he can figure out exactly who slipped it to him, and can slip it back to them before the appointed hour...This novel suffers badly from excess padding and a plot-point for plot-point lift from Tourneur - but it is quite well-written and enjoyable on its own merits, all the same. Anyone who enjoys this book would be well advised to check out its inspirations - and the same goes vice-versa, for fans of Tourneur's movie and James' original story."

That is the mission assigned to Robert Jordan.Blow it up at at the perfect time for it to be blown up, and that time is not set... he must know when to do it, and he has to figure that out himself.This is how the story of Robert Jordan, an American Expatriot opens, in the midst of the backdrop of the Spanish Civil War. Hemingway does a great job setting the scene, describing just enough detail to put you there. He also manages to give you a nice taste of Spanish culture, and it's various attitudes.The Spaniard's love of seafood is featured in Pilar's description of Valencia, Spain is second only to Japan in seafood consumption.What is very interesting is the dialogue. Hemingway goes to great lengths to accurately translate the way Spaniards speak to each other with formality. There are a lot of Thee's and Thys, and the structure of the speech is a little difficult to get used to.It took me a while to understand why I kept reading things like ""I have indescribable and unprintable and I have forgotten the obscenity password."" Indescribable, unprintable, and obscenity probably have more to do with the censors of 1940 than anything else. Still, it does a nice job of conveying the notion that an obscenity in Spanish carries a lot more weight than does one in English.This novel is high adventure, and Robert Jordan, his political affiliations notwithstanding, is a hero's hero. If you decide to look into reading a book that sits among the list of classics, here's one that truly deserves the title!"

Gibran is justly famous for rich metaphors that brilliantly highlight the pursuit of Truth and Goodness amidst all the darkness and light of human nature.This is a book to read alone or with a partner, to give and receive, to go back to again and again.Note: the excerpts available in Amazon's ""Search This Book"" facility unfortunately do not do ""The Prophet"" justice, since only the book's introduction is included, whereas the wisdom does not begin unfolding until a bit later. Therefore I've taken the liberty of including here another excerpt which more properly demonstrates the gentle power of Gibran's writing.---And a woman who held a babe against her bosom said, ""Speak to us of Children.""And he said:Your children are not your children.They are the sons and daughters of Life's longing for itself.They come through you but not from you,And though they are with you, yet they belong not to you.You may give them your love but not your thoughts.For they have their own thoughts.You may house their bodies but not their souls,For their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow, which you cannot visit, not even in your dreams.You may strive to be like them, but seek not to make them like you.For life goes not backward nor tarries with yesterday.You are the bows from which your children as living arrows are sent forth.The archer sees the mark upon the path of the infinite, and He bends you with His might that His arrows may go swift and far.Let your bending in the archer's hand be for gladness;For even as He loves the arrow that flies, so He loves also the bow that is stable."

The love making scenes were ridiculous, what was this ""thou, oh, oh thou oh oh oh"" garbage? It took me a week to get through this book, which from reading other bad reviews is pretty quick work of this novel.This novel wasn't all bad, which is more than I can say for Catch Number 2 (that was not an error). The three action packed scenes (The murder of the ""fascists"" at Pablo's town, Sordo's battle, and the blowing of the bridge) were actually pretty entertaining. These were the fastest chapters of the book though they were the longest. I did a little research on Hemingway and found that he had a minimalist style and liked verbs more than adjectives, and didn't like flowery language, I feel the man could have used an adjective or two to liven up this dull dead book.Oh and watch out for that long drawn out paragraph that goes something like this ""Now, all now, and now I say now all we have is now and then now this is now and now i what we have"" that's pretty close to what he wrote and it continues with the ""nows"" Then there was the DIRECT translation of Spanish. What was that all about? ""Less bad""? That's ""menos mal"", which means literally less bad, but in English it sounds STUPID. It's different when you read this book and are fluent in Spanish you see why the English is not less bad but all bad. And what of the Thees and thous? And Nays? I get it, they were speaking archaic Spanish, one sentence at the beginning telling us that would have been sufficient, now I have to feel like I'm reading a 15th century novel. The whole Robert Jordan thing was also annoying, just call him Bob or Robert or Jordan. Lastly, what's with te glorification of communists?

It has a depth and a substance to it that you don't usually find in your typical ""beach read"". It's obvious that the author did her research into the time period (post-Depression America), and the subject matter (traveling circuses). According to the author's note at the end of the book, many of the compelling anecdotes in the story were based upon real events, culled from the diaries and personal histories of old-time circus performers. As a result, Water for Elephants is a novel that boasts the rare combination of being both entertaining and informative.The main character is a cantankerous, still-sharp 93-year-old man, and his frustration at being trapped in an old man's body is palpable. The story of his incredible life and adventures with the Benzini Brothers circus unfolds in a way that is emotionally wrenching, and yet flashes of good humor pervade throughout. The characters are richly drawn, and even the animals are given complex personalities that make them a pivotal part of the story. There is something in the novel for everyone: it is equal parts adventure, mystery, fictional memoir, love story, and historical account.I highly recommend this book!"

It was given me by an historically minded Delhi-wallah, and he couldn't have offered a better volume. Mr. Dalrymple not only spent a year in Delhi, he spent centuries in the history of the 7 Delhis that have been built and lost. This is not a &quot;go here, see this&quot; sort of travel book. It is a &quot;discover the wonder&quot; book. Modern Delhi is a mess of a city, but Mr. Dalrymple takes us deeply beyond the mess into the wonder that exists and the magic that was. The incredible political and family history of Shah Jehan the founder of Delhi (Shahjehanabad)is the &quot;Godfather&quot; story of family members who would stop at nothing to win the empire. There is a severed head in this story that makes the horse's head in &quot;The Godfather&quot; look like child's play. This small portion of &quot;City of Djinns&quot; is worth the price of admission.

The culmination ofhis adventures is the most famous of the Westernbattles - Custer's defeat at the Little Big Horn.But Flashman doesn't spend all his time fightingIndians. He would much rather be in the arms of abeautiful woman. And he succeeds in this endeavor,not once, but several times during the course ofthe novel. First, we meet Susie, the madam of abrothel he happens to encounter on his way west.Of course, he can't remain faithful to her forlong, not with all those other women (the ""sluts""as he calls them) that are so available. Finallyhe must abandon his new ""family"" to continue hisjourney, but that doesn't end his womanizing. Whenhe is captured by the Apaches, he saves his lifeby seducing the chief's daughter! And we don'twant to miss the mysterious Mrs. Candy who takeshim on his last journey west.But the joy of this book is not just the marvelousadventures Flashman has, nor is it the great character Fraserhas created (a man you love to hate). This is a book where thelanguage is equal to the story. As Flashman describes his nearbrushes with death, we can feel his fear, fear that he is ableto cover up when others are around.This is a book that will keep you on the edge of your seat, butyou'd best hold on tight, or you'll fall off laughing.(NOTE: Since one of Flashman's characteristics is his amorousnature, there are several rather ribald passages. They are notpornographic or vulgar, but they are suggestive. I found themquite funny, but if they bother you, just skip a few paragraphsand you'll be in safe territory again.)"

Maybe I expected too much because of all the hype and the movie coming about a month after I read it.The premise was great- a Cornell educated kid drops out during his exams due the death of his parents, and finds himself transported into the world of a circus train during the Great Depression. The story is told sort of as a flashback, it goes back and forth between Jacob as a ""90 or 93 year old man"" and Jacob as a 23 year-old college dropout. It sets itself up to be touching, moving, etc., and it does take you back to a time that's grand and terrible. But it falls flat. The author could have done so much with Jacob, Marlena and August. The brightest spots of the novel are Jacob in old folks home- we really get to see his character there. Marlena was beautiful but boring, and August was brilliant but crazy. We see several spots where she could have gone deeper with all three characters, bur fails to so so.The author telegraphed the ending a mile away, but that era wasn't about happy endings. That era was about sadness, struggling and being down on your luck.The other bright spots of the novel occur when the author describes Rosie the elephant, and the ins and outs of the circus and how it works. It is clear she did a lot of research on how the circuses worked, and it was nice to be able to picture those details.The book had so much potential. I wish it would have been better."

It is about the traveling circus back in the Great Depression Era and offers you a glimpse of a fantasy life that you'd never imagine on your own. She did tons and tons of research on circuses back then so everything is extremely realistic and she covers topics that have always interested me (like prohibition, speakeasies, and the intelligence of animals). To make the book even more relevant to readers today, she weaves the past in with the present to create a masterful story that you'll remember for years to come.A lot of times, after I finish reading a book I'll forget how it ended in just a few months... not in this case though, the ending gave me goosebumps and I'll always remember it vividly."

6,3.12,0.9991,2014,07-29,5478700,Wholesome Grub,Plano,,Kentucky,Championship,8,"This book does provide a fairly riveting story set within post depression America and also provides good insights into the circus business during this era. The book balances the dynamics of maintaining a circus in tough economic times against a host of vivid and disparate personalities that can both support and challenge the stability of the circus. For example there is Big Al who runs the circus with a nearly ruthless practicality, ""redlighting"" individuals who violate his rules. There is August, second in command, alternately tough and gracious, supportive and cruel. There is Jacob, the hero, who stumbles into the world after fleeing Cornell Vet School and who subsequently falls in love with August's wife. The book alternates between the young Jacob in the circus and the elderly Jacob in a nursing home. Some of the dialogue the characters use during the depression era sounds like it came from the 21st century but other than that there is a gritty, often grotesque and unblinking realism in everything from death to romance."

On rereading For Whom the Bell Tolls, I was reminded of what thrilled me long ago when one could speak of ""serious"" fiction without ironic intent.ExoticismAll of Hemingway's work has an exotic locale with an unusual American driving the narrative. In this novel, Robert Jordan, a professor from Montana, is a demolition operative with a group of guerillas in the Spanish Civil War. He lives in the mountains, eats rabbit stew with partisans, is fluent in the dialect, makes love with a senorita in his sleeping bag, destroys bridges with steely skill and faces death with aplomb.StyleHemingway's direct and lucid style is in full form. It sounds great when read aloud. Nobody did it better.In this novel, much of the dialogue is memorable because of the literal translation from peasant Spanish. No English speakers would carry on as they do, and the arcane cant with its earthy directness permeates the whole novel.In 1940, Hemingway was unable to use 4-letter curses. He had to substitute the word ""obscenity"" or ""nameless"" yielding something like ""I obscenity in the milk of your nameless mother."" Well, it's not very shocking, but I'm happy old Hem was stuck with that translation. Had the Bell been fouled with English vulgarities, it would have come off today as quite common and the exoticism would be considerably dampened.WomenMaria is Robert Jordan's love, but she is unremarkable as a character. In those times, a warrior's love interest had to be air-headed and adulatory. However, Pilar, the woman who commands the guerillas is an unforgettable person. She is too fat and ugly to bed, but her skill as a story-teller and judge of people are superb.PoliticsIn politics Hemingway was pro-peasant and he fought facists throughout Europe. In his latter years he complained about J. Edgar Hoover tailing him, and perhaps it was not delusory. Americans who assisted the Republicans (they were the good-guys in that time and place) were branded as Commies and were forever on the FBI trouble-maker list. It was courageous of Hemingway to make a collaborator like Robert Jordan his hero.Buddhist TouchesRobert Jordan is no monk, but he does live by some prime Buddhist principles. He goes on for some length about living in the now- there may be no tomorrow. Just before his death, he explains to the Maria that wherever she goes, so will he be there. A mystical touch that cannot heal their parting.And SoRead this novel to be transported to a time and place beyond the memory of all but the very old. Human nature is displayed in the extreme- both base and uplifting. It is one of the last great war novels that told its story without a blink.Hemingway's appeal is not very complicated. Growing up I knew some outdoorsmen and war heros, but they tended to be illiterate or mute. I knew some good writers, but they tended to be bookish dweebs. Ern could negotiate both camps, and he was the first writer to seize my attention. I think he'll be charming readers for a long time."

5,3.06,0.9971,2008,08-14,11535200,Punjab Sweets,Kent,$$,Mount St Marys,East,16,"I've read two other previous books by Hemingway. Feel free to read those reviews as well. In his best piece, Old Man and the Sea, Hemingway describes a man's courage and conviction in a mini-epic struggle between and elderly man and the greatest catch of his life (a giant marlin). In another book, The Sun also Rises, Hemingway paints a very rich and colorful portraitt of Spain and Pamplona that I could not sum up in a few sentences. Both books create a vivid picture almost unequaled in literature.This book, however, does nothing of the sort. Excluding a side story that concerns the massacre of a town of locals, it is repetitive, boring, and provides little insight. The majority of this 450 page book takes place in one cave and provides very little substance. Personally, no picture was painted for me, no human character was exposed, and no real lasting meaning came from this book.I grew tired of the cave, tired of the speculation about killing the Guerilla leader Pablo, and bored of the lightweight, unreal romance. An editor could have spliced away pages 200-400, and the book would have not missed a beat.If you're a casual reader like myself, stick with other Hemingway works."

The story is wonderful, but the methods she uses to weave the human existance into it is simply breathtaking. If you do not like to cry after reading a book, I recommend you avoid it. The bittersweet human connection in this book is outstanding and she has truly captured circus life in the depression years as no other book has ever done. A truly wonderful read."
6,3.26,0.9911,2004,02-06,10142400,Village Inn,Canoncity,$$,Northern Iowa,Midwest,14,"An interesting premise, Water for Elephants: a melodrama that takes place in a traveling circus during the first half of the last century. Throw in forbidden love, an abusive husband, murder, and a few other plot twists, and you're assured a best-seller followed by a Hollywood movie with a topnotch cast.I went to the circus as a boy; I never wanted to run away with it, but I enjoyed it; then again, I never feared clowns.I've had Water for Elephants on my reading list for more than a year; it was highly recommended to me but it just kept getting pushed down on my reading list. Finally, with the movie due out, I opted to make reading it a priority.I won't say I didn't enjoy it, but I can't say either that it's deserving of all the accolades it's received. Author Sara Gruen obviously had a passion for the circus, as evidenced by the research that went into this piece and the period.Normally I enjoy melodramas--Victor Hugo's Laughing Man comes to mind. But Elephants, for some reason I can't quite put my finger on, just missed.Maybe it's just me. Some call Romeo and Juliet the greatest love story ever written. I happen to think it's the most overrated piece of literature ever penned. I mean, come on, Romeo falls instantly in love with Juliet the first time he ever lays eyes on her, and only after they part does he realize he forgot to ask her for her name. Can true love be founded on such a shallow premise? No, he's just reacting to hormones. It's young love, which is not really love at all, merely lust.At first I thought it was because Ms. Gruen wrote the piece from the perspective of a male protagonist, and like a lot of cross-gender writing, it somehow lacks a certain authenticity. But Jacob is a likeable enough young man, flawed; recently orphaned, he joins the circus to what we in the 21st century would say, ""Find himself."" He certainly is attracted to Marlena, initially, for all the reasons a 20-year-old young man would be: she looks great in her pink sequined riding costume.But it wears old after a while--we want to see a relationship grow between them. What the story reveals is that Marlena, married, suffers from Battered Woman Syndrome. Her husband is mentally unbalanced and jealous to the point of insanity. He accuses her of infidelity with Jacob even though nothing has happened--except in their own mercenary hearts.Well, we were ready to impeach Jimmy Carter for admitting he'd lusted after women in his heart. Even the bible teaches that if your thoughts are impure, if you're unfaithful in your mind, you're just as guilty as if you'd committed the act. But nothing has happened between these two innocents except a shared kiss. But because her husband is such a beast we accept that it is okay and feel sympathetic toward Marlena since she is committed to make it work with her unbalanced husband because her parents previously told her, when she wanted to come home after admitting to them the marriage had been a mistake, that she had to lie in the bed she'd made.Yet I found neither Jacob nor Marlena very sympathetic; neither character was very memorable, even if the writing was sharp, crisp and authentic to the period. My sympathies lay with Rosie, the poor elephant who suffered such abuse at the hands of Marlena's husband she, the elephant that is, eventually killed him.Now that I've had more than a week to think about Elephants, to capture what seems to be an elusive reason for my indifference to this book, it occurs to me that a lot of books these days are written in this fashion, they expect the reader to connect with the character in their own way.I understand what that means and I don't disagree with it--until it's taken to an extreme and I'm presented with cardboard characters, caricatures.I want to connect with characters, not become them. I want to see how others respond to adversity. I can always later compare what I would've done, how I would've thought, were I in those circumstances.I guess, in the end, that's what was missing for me in Elephants: I just couldn't connect with Jacob or Marlena.Or, maybe at my age I just don't get young love anymore."

After a layoff, I returned to the series and while I enjoyed The Mauritius Command, I thought there was somewhat of a slip from the first few books of this 20 novel series.The novel opens promisingly, with Aubrey suffering in a less-than-ideal domestic situation. His mother-in-law lives with Jack, his wife Sophie and their cranky daughters, and his efforts to manage a farm are comical in his ineptitude. When Maturin visits, and Aubrey tries to show him around and put a brave face on his domestic struggles, the comedy inherent in O'Brian's writing comes shining through. While Jack (and the reader) itch to get to sea, it is there that O'Brian seems to lose control of the story.Aubrey gets an order to go to the Cape of Good Hope, where he is sent on a mission to dislodge the French from the Mauritius Islands and help set up a British Colonial Governor by the name of Farquar. As is usually the case, despite great achievements in the past, Jack is shackled and insufficiently rewarded by his superiors in the admiralty, and his supposed connections, through his father in the Parliament, are of little help.O'Brian seems to assume a good bit of nautical knowledge by the reader, and this landlubber sometimes got a little lost in the naval warfare scenes. The most engaging aspects of the novel seemed to me the differences in character, and the seething one-upsmanship among the various ship captains under Jack's overall command including Captains Pym, Clonfert and Corbett. The problem was, just when the author whets your appetite for some great internal conflict or drama between the brutal Corbett and the popular Clonfert, Corbett is sent from the area.Moreover, the final battle scenes are almost thrown together in summary form, as if the culmination of the mission did not really concern O'Brian as much as the hassles of getting there, and so there was a bit of a letdown at the end. I look forward to the next novel (Desolation Island I think), but have to be luke-warm in my praise of this one. I give it a fairly generous 4 stars, 3 and 1/2 if I could."

We haven't discussed the book in my reading group yet, but I think that the book raises a lot of good points for discussion (i.e. &quot;would we have done X this way? Would there be alternatives?&quot;).My biggest complaint with the book was his rambling ad infinitum about the Martian land features. I honestly believe that the book could have been 150 pages shorter, and equally enjoyable to me if he'd have left out most of this. In fact, it appeared to me that characters made often seemingly pointless treks around Mars just so the author would have a reason to describe each area. I think I may have been so put off simply because I have absolutely no interest in geology, but the other people in my reading group felt pretty much the same way. This was my only real complaint with the book, but it was such a complaint that I docked it two stars.Overall, I'm pretty sure I wouldn't have given the book a Nebula award, but barring the complaint above, I found it to be very thought provoking, and I look forward to discussing it with my reading group.

We share the queen's frustration and regret that she chose such a conspicuous, high-status vehicle, especially when she tells us that her brother-in-law picked a shabby carriage for his own (ultimately successful) escape. Our frustration mounts as the party of escapees makes blunder after blunder, such as missing connections and stopping to let the royal children stretch their legs. At the same time, though, even as we readers know the attempt is doomed, we find ourselves hoping, against all logic, that it succeeds after all.My only real dissatisfaction with this novel came from the limitations the first-person narration imposed. I would have liked to have read more about what was going on outside Marie Antoinette's chambers, to learn more of what was taking place in the minds of the people around her.

Coming of age in a circus might seem cliche yet the insiders view of the social dynamics that existed within a circus really put context around the whole ""running away to join the circus"" thing; although, in this case, it might be more apt to describe this as ""stumbling into the circus"". Regardless, while I felt the end of the circus component of the story was somewhat predictable, it didn't spoil the story for me. A truly remarkable story that I will enjoy again and again."

The first book is about the journey, travelling on Mars, exploring, technology, and the like. The political struggles and interpersonal intrigue have started but this book doesn't rest on them. I wouldn't say that Red Mars is a &quot;page turner&quot; but at least it isn't a &quot;page flipper&quot; like (to me at least) the next two.Red Mars starts out being a hard SF tech novel but by the time it's done it has mutated into a mostly political work that could just as easily be written about (somewhat incestuous) neighbors wrangling for control of your own subdivision's community association. That trend continues in the later books, where the technology becomes a sort of background murmur and most of the text is devoted to longwinded and somewhat distant arguments.Enjoy Red Mars for the not terribly intimate and moderately bloated saga of planetary exploration and development that it is. But don't expect as much from the later books. They're suitable for stuck-on-an-airplane-with-six-hours-to-kill reading but not all that exciting otherwise."

6,3.19,0.99734,1988,03-24,5579000,Wrap and Roll,Driggs,,Michigan,West,3,"Like many readers, I was smitten with the world Martin created inA Game of Thrones (A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 1), was caught up in the vivid showing of the battles and the intrigue inA Clash of Kings (HBO Tie-in Edition): A Song of Ice and Fire: Book Two, and was impressed by his ruthlessness towards his characters inA Storm of Swords (A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 3). As with many readers and fans, I cut Martin some slack inA Feast for Crows (A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 4)- the storyline was just too big, apparently for a single book. A rationale I thought reasonable, and although the storyline moved at a glacial pace, I had high hopes for some resolution of loose ends from Book 4, and some forward movement in _A Dance with Dragons_. Were that it was so. _A Dance with Dragons_ was in many ways, an utter disappointment.That is not to say I found Book 5 a total bust. To avoid spoilers, I'll write in broad terms. I did like the wider sense of geo-politics Martin develops here, as the conflict in Westeros has ramifications in the Free Cities and Valyria. It was a relief to see the storylines that had diverged in _A Feast for Crows_ again rejoin each other, and readers are given a longer perspective of the political web that ""the game of thrones"" is: princes thought long dead instead found in hiding, old alliances and old rivalries between noble houses uncovered, details of storylines from the first four books (particularly around Daenyrs) brought to light. In a perverse way, I also liked the lack of resolution of some of the story lines: tantalizing clues left about what will happen with Daenerys, Arya, the dragons; characters in difficult situations that I am anxious to see solved: Jon on the Wall, Bran Beyond the Wall, and Jamie and Brienne in the Riverlands. As much as I enjoyed this, it was not enough to earn more than a mediocre review.There are many more points that I take issue with than there are redeeming features. First is the geologic pace at which the story moves. At just under 1000 pages, I had expected more forward movement of the plot. This did not happen. Stannis remains in the North. Daenerys remains in Slaver's Bay. Tyrion, for much of the story, is at sea - and so on ad nauseum with all the characters. Books One and Two moved much more quickly, and which I liked much more.. Perhaps juggling 23 story lines has simply become untenable for Martin to maintain. Another issue I had concerned the changes in authenticity of several of the characters. While I recognize characters do (and should) change across the story line, Martin has several of his characters take almost 180 degree turns from who they were in the first four books - especially Jon (""The Night's Watch takes no part in the wars of the Seven Kingdoms"") and Tyrion. I also expected at least some sort of ""chekcing in "" with other characters from _A Feast for Crows_ would happen once the storylines from Book 4 was reunited in Book 5 - specifically the happenings and goings on of Sansa and Samwell Tarley. It looks like readers will have to wait for the next installment to see what these characters have been up to. In a similar vein, Jamie was hardly mentioned at all.The divergence of story lines between Books 4 and 5 was a challenge as well. As a relative new comer to the series, I had the advantage of being able to read the books more or less concurrently (I pity those who had to wait over four years between books), but even then I frequently found myself going back to _A Feast for Crows_ to reacquaint myself with characters and their stories that I had fogotten all about, it having been 500 or 600 (or, in the case of Daenyrs) almost 900 pages since last they were a part of the story. Some sort of prologue (other than the pointless prologue involving Wargs and apprentice maesters) recaping the story thus far would have been helpful, I think.As much as I am tempted to give _A Dance with Dragons_ a one-star rating, I can't. This is a work in progress - I remain hopeful that, once the ""Song of Fire and Ice"" is completed, my objections and complaints will be inconsequential. While I remain frustrated that the story has moved so little over the last two books, I also remain optimistic that there will be a payoff in the book(s) to come. Those expectations aside, for a 1000 page investment in reading, there is precious little payoff for audiences here."

This book was a soap opera in print. The characters were mostly stereotypical, ergo predictable. I don't think giving the ending away in the prologue was such a great idea, because I spent the next 330+ pages waiting for something (anything!) to happen in that vein. Instead I found myself wading through pages of the author describing events such as tent raising, etc.. The romantic scenes were very campy. During the first several chapters when the book's format became aparent, I thought it was very fascinating to have the elder scenes interspersed with the circus scenes. It turns out that they didn't add much to the story, or even make me want to keep reading. The writing in the elder scenes was amusing, and soon those chapters became my reward for reading the cirucs chapters. The ending was perhaps the most aggravating aspect of this book. Something about Gruen's description of circus life and all its attendant characters makes me think it highly unlikely that a modern-day cirucs manager would embrace a decrepit old man and rescue him from life at the rest home. Maybe it was all those descriptions of redlighting we were given...I'm not sure. All said, I enjoyed Gruen's writing style, but I would have enjoyed it much more telling a story with some substance."

He is without a command, on half pay, and doing no more than tinkering with his telescopes. Happily, his particular friend Stephen Maturin comes bearing glad tidings: an assignment leading an expedition to capture the French-held islands of Mauritius and La Reunion just east of Madagascar.Unlike the previous novels, where Jack commands a vessel usually unattached from joint maneuvers, he here commands several ships. Unfortunately, the Commodore (as Jack is temporarily called) has a problem: the captains of the three primary ships are troublesome. Lord Clonfert nurses a long held jealously of Jack's fame and success, and has a tendency for self-promotion and showmanship. Pym is solid, but in the end lacks judgment in battle. Corbett is the polar opposite of Jack in regard to discipline. While Jack believes in discipline, he staunchly believes that brutality and frequent punishment is both cruel and counterproductive, leading to an unhappy ship. Corbett, on the other hand, is a savage disciplinarian, and keeps his crew on the edge of mutiny.All of the novels in the series have their unique appeal, and this one delights in its chronicling the course of a single campaign, a campaign that O'Brian notes is based quite closely on real events. The novel is also superb in its setting in a locale of which most readers will be utterly unfamiliar. It is also fun because more than in the previous novels, Stephen Maturin plays a more prominent role as an intelligence officer, and his work on the islands in fermenting rebellion against the French is as crucial as Jack's role in leading the military expedition.I would caution anyone tempted to read O'Brian to start with the very first novel and work from the first to the last. I deeply love these books, but they do not stand alone."

He is a dark figure with a mysterious past. He's a man admired for his action and his word. He works in black ops but has his own moral code. Clark is a man of action. This book essentially covers Clark's past. His girlfriend was murdered by Baltimore drug dealers who raped her while slowly asphyxiating her with a plastic bag. A horrific death that profoundly affects Clark. But he doesn't mope nor sit idly by. This ex-SEAL sets out upon a course of justice. He dispenses justice in the only way these murderous scum understand - by executing the drug dealers who peddle their death and addiction to adults and children. Clancy uses the story to give us greater backstory on Jack Ryan. His father, Emmet Ryan, is a detective trying to track down the killer of these drug dealers. But Clark keeps moving forward `Without Remorse'."

Im glad I didn't have to wait six years for this one like some people did. Now that I read it, I understand why many were disappointed. Its rather a bloated book. For one thing there is way too much description of family shields, clothing worn, and Westeros history - descriptions that if you read the previous four books, you already know for the most part. Way too much time was spent describing the various difficulties in traveling; yes, we get it, people get seasick a lot. Is it necessary to describe it each time it happens? The sections that take place off Westeros included way too many characters to keep track of. I found myself bored often and skimmed most of these sections (tho the part where Dany finally gets to fly was breathtaking). I also had trouble with the timeline - just how much time has passed here, and just how old are some of these leaders? Are Dany and Jon really only 15 or so? No wonder things are so screwed up. I did enjoy reading about Bran and Arya, but then they were sort of dropped and never heard of again. I loved that Cersei finally gets whats been coming to her for a long time, and loved Tyrion, as always. But he sorely needed an editor in this book, more so than any of his other books in the series. If it had been tighter narrative, this easily could have been a 4 star.That all being said - this was another page turner. I was hooked from the beginning, and while there were some sections I skimmed through, the story certainly kept my attention. As usual, he is a genius in characer development, and in showing the different facets of each character.

The characters are as unsympathetic as they come, with the 2-D Maria who has probably never entertained a thought in her head, she is so stupid and empty, except to please Robert Jordan, who spends hundreds and hundreds of pages just thinking random thoughts, and walking from place to place. I thought that Anna Karenina was long and drawn out, but even at 800 + pages that book was less drawn out than this wprthless piece. It was completely unnecessary for it to be so long--one of Hemingway's short stories, about an old man on a bridge during the spanish civil war, at less than 3 pages is ten times more movign and poignant than this book. And it doesn't even really paint the Spanish civil war all that well--if you really want a glimpse of what it was like, go rent and watch the classic movie ""La lengua de los mariposas"" or ""Butterfly"" in English, which will give you a better idea and much mroe enjoyment at the same time. This book also isn't really that action-packed at all for a war book--I'd say fighting and battle takes up maybe two-fifths fo the book at the most, it's mostly just talking, long stories, long ten page thought streams of RJ, or just walking from place to place, describing things with some of the longest run-on sentences I've ever seen (anyone who tells you that Hemingway's style was just short and simple sentences is full of it in regard to this book).In short, this book is not worth your time--read one of Hemingway's short stories if you must, but not this long, drawn out, boring yarn."

It doesn&#8217;t suffer the fate of many, many novels &#8212; even some of my best loved &#8212; but there was something missing.That&#8217;s a convoluted way of saying I enjoyed it but it didn&#8217;t stick with me.Plot and pacing are excellent in this novel. I often write that most books need to be shorter. Novelists seem to always come up with a great opening. Better ones have great endings. Most fail in the middle. That middle third of most novels is such a bore to me. I think it&#8217;s filler to beef up a word count. I didn&#8217;t find this in Water for Elephants at all. Gruen can structure a story and keep the pace going. That&#8217;s a terribly hard thing to do and she pulled it off wonderfully.With one glorious exception, however, the characterization fell flat for me. Did I care about the characters? Kinda. Did I care about the romance? No. What did touch me was the role of the older Jacob. How this young, female writer climbed into the head of a ninety plus year old man, I&#8217;ll never know but his thoughts and actions rang true. He was facing death but still facing life and his inner monologue caused an almost claustrophobic feeling in myself. My god, I kept thinking. This could very well be me - trapped in a body, aware that I&#8217;m losing my mind to age and, most frightening of all, without the ability to do a damned thing about it. I hope to elicit that kind of reaction in a reader one day.The parts of the novel confined to an old man doing nothing much more than sitting in a wheelchair will stick with me for a while. I may go back and read those bits at times. The parts with the trains, circus, performances, midgets, elephants, romance and violence? Not so much."
4,3.25,0.9966,2001,09-18,23462700,Spice Symphony,New York,$$,Fresno St,South,9,"George R. R. Martin has been compared to Tolkein, primarily because he borrows heavily from Tolkein's mythology (and openly admits as much). I prefer to think of Martin as Tolkein's evil twin: wherein THE LORD OF THE RINGS was ultimately an optimistic, life-affirming journey, A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE is its nihilistic counterpart, determined to present a blood-soaked world where anything and everything can--and will--happen.A DANCE WITH DRAGONS, Book 5, more-or-less occurs simultaneously with Book 4 (though it overtakes it in the last couple hundred pages). We're presented here with characters missing from the previous book: Daenerys, ruling a city besieged by outside armies and murderers within; Jon Snow, Lord Commander of the Watch, slowly beginning to understand the terror that is approaching, and the evils he must face within his own command; Theon Greyjoy, betrayer of the Starks, has become captive of Ramsey Bolton, and lives in quaking fear of his captor's shadow, even as Bolton makes plans to bring rival King Stannis to his knees; Tyrion Lannister, heading across the sea a fugitive and kinslayer, joined with a band of men who are more than they appear; Quentyn Martell, Dornish Prince, on a secret mission of his own. These paths and more will converge, and blood will spill, fire will erupt--and yes, winter is coming.If DRAGONS has a flaw, it's this: by now, there are so many darn characters, it's hard to care about all of them. Martin's world is intricate and well-planned; he covers every detail he possibly can, which can be a bit tedious in spots (okay, a lot of spots). The story has to be this complex, of course--that's what helps ground everything, even the magic, in reality. Thus, it's a forgivable flaw, though readers will certainly find the going a little slow in spots. Tension still mounts, of course--if anything, that's what keeps fans coming back: where is Martin going with this? No one really knows except Martin himself, of course, but we can be certain on one thing: it's not going to be a happily ever after."

Martin descended into some Sisyphean hell where he is forever condemned to pen a saga he has come to detest? Apparently wearied of Westeros, he appears to pine instead for persianesque climes. But, unlike the One Thousand and One Nights, these 1016 pages are unlikely to beguile either king or commoner.Even before this volume, Martin evidences a slipping of the literary leash. Not only does his continued killing off of important characters often feel arbitrary and capricious, but the methodical physical and psychological maiming of the remaining protagonists cripples the story itself. Deaths and devastating injuries should be significant in fiction. They should propel a plot in an importantly different direction. So far, this has not happened in A Song of Ice and Fire. There have been numerous opportunities for such an occurrence, but then a central figure is dispatched, and the particular narrative falters.By A Dance With Dragons, some of the original POV/subplots should be merging. Instead, they are wafting farther apart and are being weakened in entanglements with dozens of new personages and precipitous plot swings. At times, by fits and starts, the story seems to be morphing into a decidedly different tale. But, then, such digressions prove to be mere dalliances as Martin purges his yarn of one more character with whom he has apparently become bored. It makes a reader want to bite her lip in despair. For Martin's writing style is just as bold and true as ever. His descriptions are finely drawn and deliberate and his dialogue as crisp and engaging as in A Game of Thrones.Hardcore fans are bound to engage this book, even if they have to endure legions of new characters, whether nameless wildlings or non-Westerosi with non-memorable monikers. Such fans will do so simply to revel in the further (mis)adventures of Tyrion, Jon, Cersei, Dany, et alia.After all, Winds of Winter is coming."

How desperation drives people to do tragic things to one another, yet just when you think all is lost, a surprising hero can save the day.As with any good story, the author must offer conflict and contrast, and as much as animal cruelty existed in the story, so did an intense love for animals that some of the characters had. In many ways this story was one of good vs. evil set in the unusual backdrop of the circus train.This is one of my new favorites. I read it twice, about a year apart and I enjoyed it as much the second time."

5,3.14,0.9928,1990,01-11,5486500,The Marketplace,Guilford,,Xavier,Midwest,6,"I adore this book. I love the characters and they are so well written as to visualize them. I like the use of first person narration of the main character Jacob Jankowski. It is interesting to go from the present to the past, and back. It really integrates the progression of the character rather than a linear progression. I read this book a couple of years ago, but reading it again, I found I couldn't exactly remember the outcome and was like reading it anew. The character of Rosie is one of my favorites, inspite of the fact that she is an Elephant. August is hard to take, yet one can see before it's revealed that he clearly is mentally unwell. The tension of the triangular relationship was reminiscent of the trio in Sophies Choice. Walter the clown and Camel are both very sympathetic characters, though Walter's true nature is revealed slowly from being a crusty, mean spirited person to one with great compassion. The historical details of the depression era and circus life is so well drawn as to feel you have been working on a circus throughout this story.I highly recommend this book."
5,3.27,0.9906,1998,10-28,5740100,Vegan Fusion,Kapaa,,Davidson,South,14,"What _Red Mars_ attempts is monumental: Robinson examines humankind in work, in love, in politics, spirituality, reasoning, madness, life, and death, and attempts to chart a course for what we can become. The backdrop of Martian colonization is well-researched and intriguing in itself, and so are the science and theory that enables much of the book's social and political change. And -- lest my weighty words decive you -- this book is *fun*. A few sections drag, but there was no question that I had to find out how it would all end.The story's great flaw is that it does take place on Red Mars. Robinson lets loose a hundred brilliant, uninhibited neophiles and gives them the resources of a small nation to toy with. Many times during this book I felt like he was gratifying a high-schooler's wish for a magic wand that would let the dorks, poets, and science-fiction fans run the world. His ideas about changing humanity are still quite valid! I just wish they were realized in a setting more like the one we have to work with today.I also found Robinson's lavish, technical descriptions of Martian geology to be painful. They're well-written and doubtless scientifically interesting, but he just couldn't make me care. As a research psychologist, I also have to express that //my profession and I completley and totally disown Michel Duval//, for reasons that should become clear.Despite this, I give _Red Mars_ my hearty recommendation, and think it should be part of the universal science-fiction canon. This is because it's followed by _Green Mars_ and _Blue Mars_, which improve on _Red_ in every way. The writing improves; the characters feel more like our family; and the environment gets more and more like the mess we non-elite earthlings are faced with in real life. If you're with me in wanting to see the world become kinder, smarter, and less self-destructive, these are some ideas you should have in your head."

But Water for Elephants is just that novel. It is not for the faint hearted, and the cruelty and squalor depicted rival some of the works of Dickens. But also like Dickens there is a sheer honesty and redemption to be found, and as for the ending ... well I will not give anything away except to say that I did not see it coming.

7,3.36,0.9954,2014,04-09,7004800,Novel Cafe,Westwood,,North Dakota St,West,12,"Hemingway expertly begins this book with John Donne's poem... ""No Man is an Island..."" The main theme of this story, to me, is centered around our connection to others. No matter if they are right down the street or across the Atlantic Ocean from us. As Donne said... (I paraphrase weakly) ""Whenever someone in mankind is hurting, it hurts me because I am part of mankind and mankind is part of me.""This book has several interesting elements:1. Robert Jordan's strong sense of duty.Why does a Spanish professor from Montana decide to leave his obiviously comfortable life to fight with the anti facist guerillas in a far away country? What compels him to give up himself so completely to fight for a people that he seemingly has no connections to? Where does Robert's commitment to duty come from? These questions are addressed and answered expertly by Hemingway in the thought process of Robert, conversations he has and lived out in his very relationships.The book is dominated by Robert's ""thinking out"" of his actions in the face of what he has to do. I really enjoyed this facet of the story. I think it adds to the length of the novel but it is definitely worth reading.2. The demise of Pablo's sense of duty and passion.When we meet Pablo in this story, he is a man on the downside of his effectiveness. He no longer has convicitons. He no longer has a will to accoplish his goals. Pablo's lack of determination plays directly against Robert's and Pablo's wife Pilar. It is interesting to look at Pablo, the old leader of the rebel band... and how he is losing his influence over these people. His pride even causes him at times to hurt the anti facist cause, which he once felt so strongly about. Robert and Pilar are both on fire for the cause and it consumes them. Pablo has lost all his fire for the cause and is now apparently useless. (Pablo does experience some redemption in the end...)3. The blossoming relationship between Robert and Maria. Love in the face of impending doom.I'm not usually a big romance guy... at least in the books I read. But the love story between Robert and Maria is beautiful.It grows out of a most impossible situation, Robert the foreign freedom fighter finds Maria the ravaged former war prisoner. She does not necessarily look beautiful on the outside but Robert loves her anyway. He loves who she is, and what she becomes to him.Interesting internal discussions happen for Robert about her. I love the one that talks about how he has to in essence live a whole life with Maria in 3 days. All because he is unsure of whether he will live to have a life with her after the war. These two people really loved each other and would do anything for each other.4. The ultimate sacrifice... Self sacrifice.I don't want to get into the details of the conclusion of the story. Hate to spoil a good read. But the theme of self sacrifice comes through loud and clear. To me, this is the theme of life. We make a real difference when we give up on our sense of self and make an impact on others. Whether they are people we are closely and intimatly related to, or people we have never seen before. Robert Jordan gets it... he puts others first and gives up all he has.Read this book... it is a rewarding experience. It is a war novel, but you will notice I rarely mentioned the war. It is so much more than a war novel. I loved it ... I think you will too."

The author does a great job of transporting you to this era and what it actually like to be apart of a great circus traveling by train. The author gives very detailed and explicit images of the scenery, animals, costumes and characters.However there are not smooth transitions from character to character due to the main character telling the story as an older man and hid younger self. It was hard sometimes to distinguish the difference between characters so much so I had to go back and re-read a page an then be like oh okay this is so and so.***SPOILER ALERT BELOW***I didn't care for the ending of this book either. I didn't think that it was realistic for the main character to leave his nursing home without aide (since in the story he can barely make it from the table to the window). Also he can barely button 3 buttons on his shirt, so how is he going to sell tickets at the booth to the circus? He meets a young man and he just volunteers to take care of him for the rest of his life (and he's 93)? This young man that he meets is no relation to him, it's just really hard foe me to believe that a young man running a traveling circus would take this all on."

Was it as bad as a lot of people say? I don't think it was all that bad. I figured that the first books that Martin wrote were all setting the stage, so that this book would be more action packed - I was very disappointed in that aspect. There were a few shocking things that happened in this book (although you had to wait quite some time for them). Some people did think that the shocking things that did happen were kind of pulled out of thin air - flashes in the pan that had no set up prior to them. I can also see where they're coming from when they say that the POVs of Daenerys and Tyrion were a bit of a let down - Daenerys, who has thus far been a strong character is indecisive and Tyrion who has been charming and clever is crying, drunk mess. It's true this book has a lot of let downs, but I think it also has a few redeeming qualities. Well, I'm glad I read the book. I think it's worth the read as long as you aren't expecting a masterpiece."

A tragic chain of events have caused Jacob to hop on this train, but the ride also causes him to meet the love of his life. The author does a brillant job of telling this story of Jacob's circus life from his own memory at the age of ninty or is it ninty three while recovering in a nursing home. This story in a story is truly delightful how Jacob handles the aging process and the other people in the nursing home. I was very impressed how the author handled the transition between stories. While the circus brought many people laughter and excitment during the ""Great Depression"" and ""Prohibition"", I found that the life was very tragic for some of the workers and animals.

It turns out to be a circus train. The story alternates between the few months Jacob spends with the Benzini Bros. circus during the Depression and the current day, in which Jacob is 90+ years old and an unhappy resident of a nursing home. Although most of the story centers on the circus years, the author does an excellent job of showing the loss of companionship, the loss of independence, and the loss of dignity that accompany old age. It's these passages that ultimately make this a sad book for me. No matter how the circus portion of the story turns out, we know how unhappy Jacob is at the tail end of his life.Although Jacob falls in love with Marlena, the unhappily married star of the equestrian act, the love story wasn't the main focus of the story for me. In fact, that aspect of the story didn't pick up steam until fairly late in the book. It was more of a coming of age/adventure story. The author did a wonderful job of researching Depression-era circus life and making the reader a part of it. And what a brutal life it was: the horrors of poisonous bootleg liquor, prostitution, terrible treatment of both animals and staff members, lack of pay, and &#34;red lighting&#34; - throwing people off the moving train who had fallen out of favor or were simply no longer worth the expense. If they were lucky, they were thrown off near a town. If they were unlucky, they were thrown off a trestle. But it's also a story of survival and caring among both the animals and the people. It's a fascinating story and I highly recommend it, even though I found it to be a bit sad."

There are beautiful watercolour illustrations throughout that were painted by the authors wife and which are reproduced in black and white. These really add an extra dimension to the book and I enjoyed coming across a new painting every ten pages or so. Dalrymple's descriptions really conjure up life in the Delhi of the past, as well as making you envisage modern day life based on his own events and experiences. You can almost taste, smell, see and hear the Delhi he so richly paints for us and some of the Islamic poetic phrases he stumbles across are at times simply breathtaking. Delhi is portrayed as a mix of Sikh, Muslim, Hindu and British in one bubbling pot, with the creativity and conflicts this diversity engenders. The friendships Dalrymple strikes up are a pleasure to read and add some humour and insight to the overall book. All in all, this was a delightful read that captures the essence of Delhi in just over 300 pages. It is easy to read and offers an accessible introduction to the various stages of Indian history from the perspective of one town.

Being the depression and few work opportunities available, the character finds himself working with a circus.

5,3.1,0.99534,2004,07-14,4426500,,Edison,,Valparaiso,Midwest,15,"""Partisans"" is one of those disappointing adventure novels that build up a nice head of steam before crashing into a wall.During World War II, a Yugoslavian agent under apparent German command takes a team of compatriots deep into his native country, where Italian, German, and their Cetnik ""allies"" watch each other as suspiciously as they do their Partisans foes. The agent, Petersen, has a message to deliver, though what that message is and who he has to deliver it to is a mystery.What makes ""Partisans"" enjoyable is the leisurely way it begins, with much circuitous banter and some dark doings on darkened city streets and aboard an Italian torpedo boat. You know Petersen can't be working for the Nazis, but what about those with him? Who can he trust? Who can we trust? One settles in expecting a variant of the commando tales MacLean famously presented in such books as ""The Guns Of Navarone"" and ""Where Eagles Dare,"" though laced with a welcome sardonic edge courtesy of Petersen.Agreeing an attempted assassination against them was committed by amateurs, Petersen adds: ""But the effect of an amateur bullet can be just as permanent as a professional one.""Or take his impression of an Italian officer he meets: ""He's reasonable, personable, smiling, open-faced, has a firm handshake and looks you straight in the eye - anyone can tell at once that he's a member of the criminal classes.""As the novel goes on, you begin to realize it isn't going anywhere, that the banter is all you will get. The plot advances only because Petersen and his group keep getting captured by various forces who then leave them unharmed, which Petersen explains is part of his mysterious plan. A rotund pal drinks alcohol by the quart, while another keeps a strange, surly silence. A couple of women along for the trip call Petersen a ""monster,"" then break into tears over such things as having to ride a pony over a mountain.More annoyingly, one never is able to work out what Petersen is up to until the end of the novel, at which point he explains it all to you and his comrades in such a roundabout way none of it makes much sense.Maybe he was having a poke at the au currant thrillers of the time. When ""Partisans"" was published in 1983, MacLean was struggling with a form of novel he helped popularize but which had been picked up by more sophisticated writers like Frederick Forsyth and Ken Follett, who jammed labyrinthine storylines into books twice as large as MacLean's. Of course, MacLean's simpler stories could be quite wonderful, too, but here we are handed a plot so convoluted no one could understand it. Even the flap jacket for the original hardcover describes a story with little resemblance to what's in the book.That's a shame, because ""Partisans"" has the makings of a good tale, with interesting characters and a charged background of multiple, conflicting loyalties running riot in an exotic locale. MacLean throws a lot of plates in the air, and you wonder how he is going to get them all down. Then he surprises you by letting them crash to the floor."

Most people on here have written that this book is &quot;amazing&quot;, or &quot;Clancy's best&quot;. I'll agree with the former; the latter will always be up to debate.This book is different than the typical Clany novel in two ways.1) It doesn't feature Jack Ryan.2) It's a personal story.The first point is self explanitory, but the second may need clarification. Those that have read Clancy's other works understand his strenghts: weaving interesting characters in a technical environment designing thick plotlines that span global environments (that may have sounded dumb but it's true).Without Remorse is none of that. It's the story of one man and his quest for vengence. It's also an exploration of whether or not can be justified. Clancy keeps pushing the envelope, baraging the character(s) with events that will test even the most forgiving person's morals. Is vigilanteism justified? I've never read a book that poses as many arguments for it. And yet, even after Clancy makes every excuse in the world to justify Clarks actions in the book, he plainly and tastefully keeps the book as a whole objective, never glorifying violence.In the setting of Clark's quest for vengeance we also get to witness Clancy writing in a more intimate and emotional fashion. The book rarely strays from Clarks point of view (a first for this writer who is known for bouncing all over the place). The story really moved me emotionally a few times as Clancy unfolded the lives of the characters (almost cried in one part).People expecting stereotypical Clancy may be disappointed by this departure, but don't be mistaken; this is a fine book in it's own right. Never have I been more impressed with Clancy's writing.Why only four stars then? Well because honestly the book is not as strong on the plot department as most Clancy books, and the ending is not as climactic as Clancy readers have come to expect. This isn't to say the book is weak in those departments; just not that strong. The other strengths of this book help make up this novel's 'very good' (4 star) rating."

So, despite the shortcomings of this book, it is still better than many others on the market.A Feast for Crows and A Dance of Dragons should have been ONE book. Had they been edited properly, removing the constant description of nobles and their arms/crests, etc., there would have been an, almost, excellent book.My biggest complaint is the repetitious descriptions and the cliff hangers. Books 1 - 3 were amazing books! They wrapped up some plots while furthering the overarching plot. This book, unfortunately, runs around in circles trying desperately to avoid anything that might have been ""predicted"" by fans. So, where does that leave things? Outrageous, ridiculous occurrences. That's where.If you are a fan of this series, borrow the book from a friend or a library. There are some fantastic parts in it and we can only hope and pray that the next book will come in a timely manner and make a heckuva lot more sense than parts of this one did.As for the treatment of 'main' characters... I am really disappointed with the arbitrary murder, etc. of characters just for shock value. Can we get back to the fantastic, meaty books of 1 - 3? Please?"

I'm not much into romance, but this is so much more than that so I couldn't pull myself away. As a bonus I learned about the dark side of the circus industry during that era. Gaslighting, where they throw the circus hands off the train in the middle of the night to avoid having to pay them, was a new term to me. Despite the cut-throat world they live in, the young veterinarian protagonist and the circus star he has a crush on, try to rise above it all at risk of life and limb.What tops it off is the story has one of the most satisfying endings I've encountered in a long time.

Since obviously I couldn't discuss much with him, but he still wanted to know, as everyone else has been wanting to know:""Is it good?""Yes it's good. It's better than a Feast for Crows by virtue of it's characters alone. But wow, it's also incredibly frustrating. Sorry for the quick change of mood there, but that's exactly what it's like to read this book. Moments will make you snap to attention and instantly remember why you've waited so long for the series, and how you loved it in the first place. This book has the power to draw you away from your world and into its. But these are but brief illuminations in a dark and often blindly led journey.Dance's biggest problem is it's pacing, which is to say stop and go. Whenever you think something major is about to happen, the book seems intent at preventing it. And yet this is a gargantuan of a novel. What makes up the extra space in between actual happenings? Exposition and traveling. So much of what is spoken could have only been mentioned and still had the same effect. Take for instance every Victarion Greyjoy chapter. Are the iron born interesting? Yes they are and very much so. Is there any amount of information in his chapters that couldn't have been neatly condensed into one? No.This becomes a problem later on when things should be picking up but never seem to. There is hardly a character in this book that doesn't seemingly have their story end one chapter (or more) too short. And not in the ""I must know what happens next"" way, but rather in the ""I fear this may be another six year cliffhanger"" manner. Then there is the almost laughable cases of Bran and Davos. I swear to the seven that I flipped back through the book just to make sure that I didn't somehow miss more of their chapters. Let me save you the time. You didn'tThe other major problem is actually some of the characters themselves. Yes, they are much better than the ones we got in Feast for Crows, but only barely. The biggest offender is no other than Tyrion himself. His story is long, mildly eventful, sometimes utterly bizarre (in ways good and bad), but worst of all (and I can't believe I'm writing this) it's humorless. A chuckle here and there maybe, but for the most part Martin loses his way with Tyrion's dialogue. Danerys sadly fairs much the same. She (and Tyrion for that matter) has some INCREDIBLE moments in this book, but for the most part she spends her time spinning her wheels and kicking up mud all around here the whole time. Yet again, it's all in an effort to end the story in an interesting place and then take what may happen away for another day. Which leads us to Jon Snow. The strongest of the three major characters, Jon's story sees him discovering leadership as well as himself as a person. It's a good story with some great little moments, and even in its' drawn out passages it still seems the most driven. Yet it ends with not only a cliffhanger for his own situation, but the ones of others as well who don't get their own final chapters.There's also a problem with new additions. I'll be brief. Tyrion meets an uninteresting dwarf woman who gets much dialogue and time, Danerys is practically surrounded by a cast of ""who?""s that you get to know and become ""who cares""?, many sell sword companies are introduced out of the blue and now have quite a bit of sway. None of those compare to the holy mother of ""huh?"" characters however. For the sake of extreme spoilers I will not mention the name, but the character comes right out of the blue and can completely change everything that has been done so far. I hope there is a satisfying reasoning to this...surprise and it wasn't just done to give us a mini-me version of a well dead character we could never have, but I fear the later.Yet I give this book 3 stars, and I say it is good. That's because it is. For instance take the surprising quality of the Reek chapters. By now, I'm going to assume it's no major spoiler to say that Reek is Theon Greyjoy. It might be a spoiler however to let you know that his chapters might be the best in the book. They are purposeful, deliberate, and constantly interesting. They also introduce us to some fantastic new villains in the Boltons, and just for hell he becomes a rallying point of sorts for other major characters. In Theon's story you will find that old magic once again that the first three books had in spades.He's not the only one. Davos and Bran may be cut short, but what's there is great. The activities of King Stannis and those around him are always interesting and make for some of the best intrigue in the book. Asha Greyjoy has a short but sweet story that puts her in an active position within the overall story. Ser Barristan Selmy has a few very, very good chapters. And while I still find Tyrion's chapters to be boring, Jon and Danerys overall provide the major plots of this tale, and both contribute enough to make it worth while. The best characters though? The precious few chapters we get from the Feast for Crows gang. Not only do they advance the unresolved plots of Jamie, Cersei, and No One, but they are also some of the best written of the bunch further suggesting that Martin knows where he going with the plot, but that he needed these last two books to turn a real big ship around to get there.Then there are those moments. In fact I retract my earlier statement. It's not the characters that make this better than a Feast for Crows, it's those damn moments. This installment spreads them around more liberally than its' predecessor did, and is the much better for it. This book feels more alive than A Feast for Crows, even when it's just shuffling it's feet. Plus like I said, it may take a while to get there but by the end of this book the whole overall plot feels much more on track and focused. Oh and that last chapter? Gravy. Pure indulgence and a fantastic bookend to both fully hype you for book six and remind you the power Martin still wields with a pen over your very soul and even your expectations.Ultimately I may have fallen under the same curse as Martin and spoke too many words. Because you will read this book and you very much should. Ultimately some will say that the wait was too long for too much unresolved. Maybe that's true. But as a whole and judged on it's own this is a more than solid entry into the Ice and Fire series and, while not destined to become everyone's favorite, is still a hard work of fiction to out right hate.But George, can I sum up quickly what fans want for Winds of Winter?More Dragons, Less Dancing."

I read this recently, since it has a reputation as one of the great Amerian novels, and my particular HS required no Hemingway. I figured the time had come.So now, having read it, I think For Whom the Bell Tolls was an important milestone, something of a product of its times. There was not yet such a body of anti-war or humanist literature as there is now...perhaps Hemingway played a role in creating that. Still, it is not just an anti-war book; intelligent people have known a long time, as Sherman put it, that war is simply ""brutality"" that cannot be made pretty. So this is not Hemingway's main point. If anything, he even sounds pro-war in the brief sections that justify the Spanish Civil War and the fight against the Fascists. (He seems a little blind to the pact the Spanish Republicans made with the devil, i.e. the Russian communists, but history had not yet proven the bloodthirstiness and corruption of the Soviet Union.)Hemingway's main theme in this book is personal honor, and how personal concerns affect one's perceptions and may override original, idealistic motives. The hero, American dynamiter Robert Jordan, has snuck behind Fascist lines to help destroy a bridge and aid a planned Republican frontal attack. But three things happen - his guerilla teammates are led by a very disillusioned old veteran, who argues bitterly with his tough old wife; and Robert falls in love Maria, with a refugee they are sheltering, raped and nearly killed by the Fascists. Finally, his spying reveals the front is losing the element of surprise. In this dangerous situation, he wants to call it all off, and retreat to a life of happiness with Maria. Sorry, no further plot will be revealed here....This way we get to study two different couples. We learn that Pablo and Pilar, the guerillas, have killed many people, up-close and personal. Pablo seems to have enjoyed it. Pilar did less hands-on killing but she and the others are still dedicated to the cause. Now here comes an outsider, a handsome young American with no real dog in this fight, bringing the front closer just when Pablo has had enough. Even worse, he falls for Maria, and sleeps with her in his own bag, outside the cave. (The love scenes, though not very graphic, are pretty juicy for their time.) Pilar tries to bolster Robert's resolve, even plotting against her husband. Maria is lost without Robert, and will follow him anywhere. But where will Robert end up going? He has committed himself, and he wants to fulfill his duty as a matter of honor. What destiny will bring the best honor for both himself and Maria? Having sacrificed so much so far, what further sacrifice do any of these people need to maintain their honor?Unlike many contemporary books, FWTBT does not have a big, overwhelming climax. Instead, the ending unfolds in a way that you might have expected, as you read it. This unfortunately left me a little cold, unable to decide whether I Love the Book, the way I do some others. But it is an indispensable milestone. Perhaps better read if you are not already so jaded or anti-war that you can't conceive of a cause worth fighting for."

After the teaser of a prologue, during which a murder takes place, the story shifts to real-time in the life of ninety or ninety-three year old nursing home resident Jacob Jakowski, as he realizes that a circus has rolled up mere blocks away. He is resigned to suffering through several standard days of monotony - wakefulness alternating with bouts of night-time and inadvertent, memory-filled dozing as he anticipates viewing the upcoming circus performance. Although his brain founders, his wit and wisdom-filled thoughts and words are spot on: of memory ""You start to forget words: they're on the tip of your tongue, but instead of eventually dislodging, they stay there,"" forced to take an antidepressant, ""You want to drug me. You want to turn me into a Jell-O eating sheep,"" on nursing home life, ""I'm so used to being scolded and herded and managed and handled that I'm no longer sure how to react when someone treats me like a real person,"" and after explaining his inability to keep track of his grandchildren and great-grandchildren, ""My brain is like a universe whose gases get thinner and thinner at the edges."" The story of his circus-related escapades is equally good. Although the ending seems more contrived than likely and the plot contains a fair amount of sexual situations, violence and animal cruelty, its uniqueness as well as several fact-based plot parts overshadow its few faults. Good books with similar themes: Life of Pi by Yann Martel, The True History of the Elephant Man by Peter Ford and Michael Howells, and All Creatures Great and Small by James Herriot."

I currently feel that it is very much worth it to read it twice, although it was excellent the first time. Many of the reviews have made the points that I want to make, but I just want to emphasize them. First, this is not a &quot;sci-fi thrill ride.&quot; It is almost a drama-documentary. I don't want to make it sound boring though. I was always involved with the reading, and almost constantly in awe of the excellent characters and vivid descriptions (of everything). There is never really a central plot. The book is divided up into chapters, each one from a different person's viewpoint. This is very effective. You will get to know many of the realistic and likable characters in depth. It is really unlike any book I've ever read in this aspect. Also, the book doesn't just utilize the physical sciences. It really shows how important the social sciences will be in the future. Although initially surprised by the politics and psychology in the book, I felt like I grew and learned a lot from the challenging questions it presents. It takes a lot of patience to enjoy Red Mars, but it is worth it. I felt the reward of reading a non-fiction science book while still enjoying it as fiction. So, if you are a patient and attentive reader, you will probably be more successful in realizing the excellence of this book. I recommend it to all who are willing to step up to the challenge."

I particularly liked the little catch-words that usually connected the ""assisted living"" chapters with the circus chapters. Gruen generally wrote in such connections, and I found them both ingeniously crafted and useful in uniting the narrative.In addition to telling a great story, Gruen gives a remarkably detailed picture of the circus world of the 1930s. I had definitely never heard of a ""cooch tent"" before reading this book, for example, and Gruen's depiction of its solo practitioner is thoughtful, humane, and free of cliches. The ideas of circuses getting booted out of town, of people getting booted off the circus trains, and of entrepreneurs cannibalizing the remnants of failed circuses were also quite fascinating.To the extent that Gruen wanted to make an analogy to the biblical Jacob story by obscurely dropped hints and anagrammed names, I think, however, that she pushed too far. This novel stands nicely on its own without this type of symbolism or metaphor."

Unlike most series novels, this one did not come after the fourth book as logic might dictate, rather it ran in conjunction with it filling out the story of all those characters who were absent in the fourth installment. At least to a certain point that is. The last three hundred pages give or take a few, pulled both novels together picking up the individuals from the fourth and throwing them into the mix.I truly enjoy Martin&#8217;s world and all the twisted, greedy and scheming inhabitants in it. While this book follows region to region as the characters continue to plot their way towards the iron throne, it leaves the reader with not just one cliffhanger, but with many. And numerous unanswered questions that are quite frustrating.

A book about a circus didn't necessarily appeal to me, but I figured it was worth a shot.This story is great. I really enjoyed the way the story alternated between Jacob in present day and Jacob's memories. In both times, he was heartwarming and sincere, even if he could be a bit cranky in his older age. :)The characters were great--well-developed and dimensional, even the ones you didn't particularly like. The whole circus feels very vivid, and I just loved Rosie to death.Overall, it was just a very enjoyable read with enjoyable characters (well, mostly, unless they weren't supposed to be). One thing that I found unexpectedly interesting was the circus dynamic--the cruelty, the hierarchy, the crazy characters. All in all, this is a very well-rounded novel and I would recommend it to anyone."

Don't make this your first MacLean book and unless you feel the desire to read every one of his books like I choose to, take a pass on it.

Louis Leakey identified one of his young assistants at Olduvai Gorge, Jane Goodall, as a promising scientist. With some advice but no training, he sent her off to Gombe Stream Reserve in Tanzania.Goodall successful observations have taught us much about chimps, and about primates in general. She earned her Ph.D despite not having engaged in any undergraduate studies, established the Gombe Stream Research Center, and became a leading scientist. Goodall documented chimps making and using tools, eating and sharing meat, and developing complex social relationships. All were novel observations violating the preconceptions of her predecessors. Goodall also gave the chimps names, fed them bananas to keep them nearby, and interacted with them in various ways - practices that attracted controversy. Her photographer (and later husband), Hugo van Lawick, helped introduce Goodall and the Gombe chimps to readers of National Geographic.In this book, Goodall tells the stories of her chimps. Though there are some small pieces of her personal story included, the focus remains on the chimps. She organizes the first half of the book chronologically around her study, and the second half analytically around chimpanzee infancy, youth, adulthood, and so on. She does not engage the sometimes-negative reaction that her work engendered, often because this young woman's observations forced ""expert"" men in the field to rethink long-held beliefs.The book is an engaging read, though it probably has more detail than a general reader wants or needs. It's also inspiring to see careful, patient observation yield big scientific payoffs."

She has more than studied it she has affectingly captured it in Rosie, a large gray elephant and the one hope of the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth, a down at the heels circus trying to make a go of it during the Depression.Now, Rosie wasn't too much of a hope because she was lovable but could not follow any command . Rosie's only unique characteristic was a seemingly unquenchable thirst for lemonade. Her inability to perform was no excuse for the intolerable cruelty visited upon her by August, the callous menagerie director who thought nothing of tossing a lit cigarette into Rosie's open mouth. He didn't limit his abuse to helpless animals but also mistreated his lovely wife, Marlena.Spellbindingly read by David LeDoux and John Rutledge Jones, Water For Elephants is at its heart the story of three - Jacob, who has lost his parents in a tragic accident, and finds a home with the circus, Marlena and, of course, Rosie. It's a poignant look at their lives set against an oppressive, sometimes degrading circus world, and a look back at our country during the grueling Depression years. Most importantly, it's a reminder of the resiliency of human beings and how love can heal.- Gail Cooke"

Oh my gawd!! Someone catch the lady who just fainted. Clancy is a great researcher, which is clear in any of his books. But...that doesn't make up for transparent characters and gratuitous plot manipulations. Now . . . I loved Clear and Present Danger and Red Storm Rising, Patriot Games was okay and Hunt For Red October was straight-out boring in most parts, but I read Without Remorse when it first came out and I had hoped that Clancy had taken a Creative Writing course in his spare time between reading technical manuals for Typhoon-class submarines and interviews with the CIA. There is a different voice to Without Remorse. Its straight-forward, kick-ass reading. Reads like an early Metallica song. This is the evolution of Mr. Clark, Clancy's spook character. Vietnam-era. Someone f*cks around with a girl he cares about and all hell breaks loose. This is, hands down, the best Clancy book I have ever read. It's like his version of Diry Harry. Great.

6,3.22,0.99226,2003,07-16,6860200,Silver Diner,Woodbridge,$$,Purdue,South,9,"I wanted to like this book. I really did. I love epic literature and, having recently fallen in love with hard sci-fi, I thought I'd love this, too. After all, it's an epic and it's hard sci-fi. It also won a Nebula award and was nominated for other prestigious awards. How could I possibly go wrong with that? Well, go wrong I did, and here's how:To begin, this book isn't really science fiction. It's like a work of regular fiction crossed with a science textbook about Mars and it doesn't do either very well. Anyone reading this review who hasn't read the book is probably scratching his head trying to figure out what I mean by that, but if you've ever read any other sci-fi, after you read this, you'll know what I'm talking about. The plot moves at a glacial pace and Robinson takes a paragraph to describe what could be adequately described in one sentence. About a third of the way through, when Robinson took a whole paragraph to describe someone screwing in a bolt, I put the book down and haven't picked it up since.I didn't get far enough into the book to get to any of the politics, but I know from reading reviews that the leader of the pro-corporate faction, Phyllis Boyle, was also an intolerant born-again Christian with an abrasive personality who was disliked by everyone else. This is predictably hackneyed, but perhaps not surprising, since out on the left coast where Robinson is from, it's a not uncommon belief that us rubes here in the hinterland spend all of our spare time handling snakes at tent revivals and voting against Democrats because we hate non-whites and gays and would rather be enslaved by Wal-Mart than see any of them get a fair chance in life.Then, there was the head of the Russian contingent, Maya Toitovna. In the real world, such a histrionic floozy as her would never get anywhere near a mission such as this, let alone be put in a major position of authority within it. In fact, most of the characters were so thoroughly annoying that by the time I finally put the book down, I was hoping that some grotesque form of alien life would show up and kill and eat them.All in all, I'm glad I checked this piece of hack trash out from the library and didn't pay any money for it. It's sad that this, along with the other books in the Mars series, have taken the place of the best-known and most extensive work on the colonization and terraforming of Mars, as it's an epic subject and it deserves so much better.If you're new to Sci-Fi and want to wet your feet, avoid this and check out something by Arthur C. Clarke. He's a master of the genre and hisCollected Storieswould be an ideal tome for you to cut your teeth on. Hell, evensomething by Lionel Fanthorpewould be better than this. His writing is at least bad enough to be entertaining and he at least steers clear of politics."

I was really excited about reading it, I know it's a bestseller and that I was probably going to like it. I admit, the real reason that made me curious about this story was that Jacob, the protagonist, is a veterinarian, like me.Jacob is a young man who is about to end his studies, when life gives him an awful surprise. His parents are dead, and he is left with nothing. Running from his old life, he jumps into the train of a circus called The Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth. He is saved from being hurled out of the train only because he's a veterinarian. The circus have a lot of animals, and they need to be taken care of.Jacob is young, innocent and a veterinarian with a big love for animals. Taking care of the animals makes him happy, and that is how he met Marlena. Beautiful, fragile, but married.I really liked this book. I loved how the author described life at the circus. It's obvious she investigated about circus, the people who worked at them, how they function, and their animals.But what I liked more was the writing. The story is told by old Jacob. He's 90 years old, or 93, and his memories about the circus, his wife and his life don't die. He starts narrating the story, but suddenly you realize you are reading young Jacob while being at the circus.Overall, Water for Elephants was a book that grabbed me from the beginning.

Starting out in 1960, Goodall, a student of legendary anthropologist Louis Leakey, set out for Tanzania to set up the first long-term research study on chimpanzees in the wild.Overcoming political strife, harsh living conditions, lacks of funding, and the initial mistrust of the animals themselves, Goodall's work grew into a remarkable long-term scientific achievement. Goodall went on to devote more than forty years of work to the study of what many believe is mankind's closest evolutionary relative.This book covers her early years, setting up the camp, establishing a rapport with the animals, and learning about chimpanzee society and behavior. She describes her own experiences as well as the experiences of several chimps that she had the experience of following closely as they lived and grew in the Gombe Stream Reservation.Goodall names the animals, and relates story after story of their personalities and their conflicts. She uncovers the dominance hierarchy of chimp society, and traces the changing leadership of the community. Goodall was the first to observe tool-making behavior in Chimpanzees, and she relates the excitement of that early discovery.In spite of her obvious affection for the animals she is studying, Goodall does not hold back when it comes to describing the brutality of some aspects of chimpanzee biology and society. She observed first-hand the devastating results of a polio epidemic on the local chimps, and she doesn't shrink from dealing with issues of aggression, neglect, and bullying that she oberved.She candidly discusses her own mistakes as well, pondering on the compromises that she made early on to get close to the animals while raising the possibility that she could be altering their behavior by her use of feeding stations and close direct interaction.Goodall's writing style is vivid, intense, and loaded with little details that bring the reader right into her world alongside the chimpanzees. She captures good scientific observations without losing her talent for storytelling, and draws readers into the lives of the chimpanzees whose lives she follows.The book is supplemented by four sections of photographs by Goodall's husband and fellow researcher Hugo van Lawick, and it also includes an appendix with illustrations of chimpanzee facial expressions and behaviors. Stephen Jay Gould writes an excellent introduction to this edition, focusing on the importance of Goodall's work and on the importance of observational technique in the sciences.This is a true classic of scientific writing, and a must-read for anyone interested in the study of animal societies in the wild."

Maybe I expected too much because of all the hype and the movie coming about a month after I read it.The premise was great- a Cornell educated kid drops out during his exams due the death of his parents, and finds himself transported into the world of a circus train during the Great Depression. The story is told sort of as a flashback, it goes back and forth between Jacob as a ""90 or 93 year old man"" and Jacob as a 23 year-old college dropout. It sets itself up to be touching, moving, etc., and it does take you back to a time that's grand and terrible. But it falls flat. The author could have done so much with Jacob, Marlena and August. The brightest spots of the novel are Jacob in old folks home- we really get to see his character there. Marlena was beautiful but boring, and August was brilliant but crazy. We see several spots where she could have gone deeper with all three characters, bur fails to so so.The author telegraphed the ending a mile away, but that era wasn't about happy endings. That era was about sadness, struggling and being down on your luck.The other bright spots of the novel occur when the author describes Rosie the elephant, and the ins and outs of the circus and how it works. It is clear she did a lot of research on how the circuses worked, and it was nice to be able to picture those details.The book had so much potential. I wish it would have been better."

The answer, of course, is experience, the real question being how one describes that crucial intangible. Water for Elephants is the story of a man's youth, the experience he gains in a short period of time. Essentially, it begins with him walking out on his final college exams and jumping a circus train almost accidentally. This book is actually structured as a series of flashbacks, with the main character in roughly the present day, bracketing each chapter with comments about his current situation in a nursing home as contrast to his past adventures. The main action takes place during the Great Depression, making for a fairly historical novel.Water for Elephants may feature a fairly original character with some serious common sense deficiencies, but Sara Gruen clearly did her research in terms of depictions of the period, inclusion of trade lingo, and depictions of animal behavior. The adultery will probably keep it off high school reading lists, but I found it a pretty good window on what it depicted of the world outside of the circus. This particular copy of the book also includes some commentary at the end regarding real circus history and anecdotes that were included in with the fiction. Other than that, I know too little about life under the big top to comment on the depiction of events, other than to say that trains often did go slow enough to jump back then, even in the countryside, unlike now.I read this novel in less than a day, finding it to be a very compelling read, with a plot full of twists, even though the most climactic scene is also presented as the hook in the beginning preface chapter. I would generally recommend it to everyone, even if you think you would have a problem with some aspects of it. Try to give it a chance. The main character is a vet, for example, and while animals are harmed in this circus, he doesn't like it any more than you."

But the thing is, for the most part these reviews only harp on the fact that ""oh, I've waited six years for Martin to finally finish it, but there's no epic battles/resolution/revelations"" etcetera and ""I waited so long for THIS? Oh man I'm done with the series"" blah blah blah. They don't actually talk about the story itself. And while I'm as critical of Martin for how absurdly long he makes his loyal readers wait between installments--especially since the argument could be made that a part of that wait is spent by him not spending as much time on writing as fans think he should--this isn't the place for those arguments. A book should be judged by its contents, not how long a reader waited for it.These people, while not completely unjustified in a lot of the criticisms they're raising--especially in the abundance of cliff hangers and open-ended storylines-- are missing the point of what, in my mind, makes A Song of Ice and Fire great--the characters, the unpredictable nature of where the plot's going to go, the wonderful world of Westeros and its environs, but again, most of all, the characters! Dance is much more about character development than other books in Martin's series, especially compared to Storm of Swords, in which almost every chapter involved some great action scene, or development, or advancement of the plot in some way.The pace here is more like that of Clash of Kings--and much better, not just barely better than Feast, which I think most will agree is the most slow-paced novel in the series. While it lacked epic scenes equivalent to the Battle of Blackwater, the wildlings' attack on the wall, or the Red Wedding, there's still plenty of solid content that should satiate most fans of the series, particularly the introduction of a storyline/group of characters that pretty much changes everything, and one cliffhanger for a certain character that I had to reread again, it was so exciting and unexpected.Again, its the characterization and not the war or overarching storyline that's the star of the show here. The POVs are essentially divided into three groups: those in the North and around the Wall reacting to the events of Mance Rayder's failed attack on the wall and Roose Bolton's rise to Warden of the North; Dany as she attempts to establish her role as Meereen's monarch and the various suitors and others attempting to reach her and her dragons; and a smattering of returning POVs from Feast for Crows which, while not completely resolving loose ends from the previous novel, do just enough to tie up those loose ends but leave the reader intrigued as to what happens next.The three main POVs are easily the most slowly paced, but they also have, in my mind, some of the best character development in the series. Jon is struggling to remain neutral in Stannis' efforts to win the north, while at the same time asserting himself as a strong commander. Tyrion has decided to embrace the image of the evil imp everyone else had wrongly made him out to be while trying to decide what to do with his life. And Dany makes decisions in her ruling of Meereen that may or not go against the destiny meant for her.I enjoyed the other POVs more than I did the main ones, but really, all of them, set the stage for what will hopefully be a brilliant next installment...whenever that may be. The new POVs (there are four--two are brand new characters and two are former periphery characters)are more or less welcome additions to the story, especially one of the new ones. Finally, Dance easily has the best one-shot POV (meaning prologue or epilogue) of the series so far.And the book isn't just nothing happening until the end as some are making it out to be--there is a HUGE revelation early on(not to mention another towards the end careless readers will miss), and one of the main POVs comes out of the gate really strong in a moment that had me cheering when I read it.No, it isn't perfect. But Martin can't make every installment of the series Storm of Swords or of its same exact caliber.Complaints for me include, that while cliffhangers aren't necessarily a bad thing, and some of them are excellent in this, others just left me going ""really? That's all we get?"" Martin definitely overuses his techniques of repeating phrases and describing food and fauna in a ton of detail. And while I enjoyed most of the POVs, I had a problem with two of the new ones--one only got one chapter, and the other, who was foreshadowed in the previous novel, just never became fully realized for me.But hey, at the end of the day, I got to be reunited with Jon, Dany, Tyrion, Bran, Davos, and other characters we haven't seen in years. And while there may not be a slambang, epic beheading, battle, or wedding people may have wanted as a reward for their long wait, there is still plenty of developments, and plenty of foreshadowing at things to come, that should leave most fans at least somewhat happy, or at the very least talking about and debating the events of Dance."

Wouk (and his researchers) have provided us with a marvelous gift in this book, which presents a cleverly developed fictitious tale set among ALL of the major events and players of this real life drama.I am writing this review in March of 2008. The US is experiencing multiple financial crises in the housing, credit, and energy markets. We are at war with seemingly unobtainable goals. We are witnessing a baffling and discouraging presidential contest. Terrorism seems to rule nearly every aspect of our lives (and even so, we are one of the safest nations on Earth - in other words, it is much worse in other places . . . .). All of that stated, March of 2008 looks like a cakewalk compared to nearly any place in the world in the late 1930's and early 1940's, when fascist (and socialist, and imperialist) politics, rapidly developing war technologies, the last vestiges of old world European colonialism, and the overwhelming power of racism (anti-Semitism, among others), combined to change the maps of nearly every major power and realign the world for the time not yet ended. This masterful work of fiction sheds a fascinating light on the rise of this war, while also providing a great story.About the fiction of this work, Wouk invented an interesting family whose characters, all taken together, are present for active roles in just about every major event of the coming war. As such, this is like a modern Shakespearian classic - we are treated to the very human actions and emotions of legends (good and bad) through the eyes of Pug Henry and his family. What a hell of a book. At some regrettable points, the book borders on sappy, and some (and I stress, only a few) scenes are just not believable (like Warren Henry being shot down over Pearl Harbor, and dropping in at his house to see the wife before snagging another plane and getting back in the fight). These missteps are few and forgivable. The characters are universally flawed, which is a refreshing departure from the typical pop fiction approach - sometimes I would find myself angry with some of these characters and their actions - what a great reaction to pull out of your reader!This is a recommended book for war and history buffs, but I think it can be enjoyed by anyone who appreciates readable fiction - particularly fiction set in the mid-20th century. The ultimate compliment: when I finished this I did not hesitate to pick up Wouk's sequel, War and Remembrance. Awesome!"

Red Mars however is so tedious that even writing a review about what is wrong with it feels a lot worse than Monday shaving.Where to start?From the huge portion of the book, around 10 to 15% of it, which reads like a tractor operation manual?From the obnoxious and unpleasant characters, with nothing to like about almost all of them?From the magic elixir of youth discovered conveniently by a handful of Martian scientists?From the overall feeling, that colonizing Mars is something like a weekend trip to the beach?I could go on for ages, but it is pointless and I already feel the chore of writing this review heavy on me. If this is the best way Mars is colonized in literature, I would be glad never to leave the Earth - Luna system and read again and again the Heinleinian colonization with the Moon Is a Harsh Mistress.Still 2 stars for a two-page debate about the preservation of Mars, where the writer rises to a level well above his potential."

It was wonderful seeing it from the patient's eyes and reading his story. I remember many a story told by patients. One was an old silent movie star! I wonder if Sara Gruen had any nursing home experiance as she nailed it including the caring and non caring type of people that work there and why some of the patients may be grumpy.

Hopping a train that by chance belongs to The Flying Squadron of the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth, Jacob hires on to care for the menagerie, his training an entre into this bizarre world; but as the novel begins, Jacob is an old man, restricted to an assisted living home, his memories sparked by a nearby visiting circus and a creeping helplessness that assaults his ageing body: ""Age is a terrible thief. Just when you think you're getting the hang of it, it knocks your legs out from under you and stoops your back.""The story is related in the somber tones of the Depression, the hardscrabble and often unscrupulous business of a traveling circus and the heartless despots who make their fortunes on the backs of men who must do anything to survive. Star performer Marlena, an equestrian, is sensitive to the needs of her horses, although her mercurial husband, August, the trainer, is obsessively jealous and given to unspeakable cruelties. Uncle Al, Benzini Brothers circus owner-by-default, is a ruthless businessman who cares little for man or beast, engaged in a quest for fame to rival the great Ringling Brothers. With his advanced training in veterinary medicine, Jacob does his best to protect the animals from their harsh existence, especially Rosie, an elephant purchased to replace Marlena's lead horse. Jacob and Rosie share an affinity for one another, the huge creature at times almost human. Because of his growing affection for Marlena, Jacob suffers August's increasing affronts, caught in a cycle of inevitable violence, certain of a reckoning.In chapters that move flawlessly back and forth in time, from the rowdy circus atmosphere to the antiseptic corridors of the assisted living home, the world is viewed through Jacob's perspective, as he rages helplessly against the decrepitude of old age and the secrets of the past. In prose both poignant and infinitely tender, Jacob dwells in both worlds, revealing the wounds of the past and the sorrows of the present. In one touching scene, Jacob awaits a family member to escort him to the circus, yearning for the Big Top with every fiber of his being, craving the familiar sights and smells of that pivotal summer of `31, the roustabouts, the kinkers, the rubes, the animals. The denouement is devastating, as inescapable as the indifferent world that turns a blind eye to the vagrants of the 30's. Yet Jacob's spirit retains the essence of his kind nature and a respect for others, a man who will not be broken by circumstances. All is redeemed in a coup d'grace that will leave the reader strangely satisfied and richer for having met this raggedy tribe of miscreants and lost souls. Luan Gaines/ 2006."
6,3.42,0.99572,1986,06-06,13080600,Kate's Joint,Newyork,,Michigan St,Midwest,5,"""Water For Elephants"" is a human story, filled with the drama of raw human living. The cover invites you to step right up and look at the shadow side. The title is a subject that the narrator, Jacob, knows far more about than anyone else, having spent years on a circus train. So even the title points to the in-your-face flavor of the story. The characters walk into the story from the rough years of the Great Depression. They all point to the darker side of our nature, while they put on a show that denies the fact. Here we find true grit: the smell of alcohol; the sight of blood; the sound of rage; the feelings of frustration.The plot includes people who grit their teeth and bear the pain. Jacob becomes addicted to his pain through the years. August struggles with mental illness. Marlena presses on in a marriage she doesn't want. A dwarf ekes out a difficult living in a world of rejection. The big boss pushes on to maintain that his world is composed of ""suckers born every minute"". The animals too also bear hardship and abuse from supposed caretakers.The story is energized by a foretaste of rebellion against the oppressive power. This early glimpse kept me moving through the whole story. Note that this is not a happy story. You're not going to read Winnie the Pooh. Sara Gruen finds a silver thread of redemption in the midst of dark clouds in Jacob, albeit a painful thread. It sticks like a tattoo through the years, making Jacob what he is in his nineties, still swinging his fists at enemies long gone. He is isolated, and to battle loneliness takes the only path at the end of the story that he knows.I guess all I wanted was a happier ending."

Here you have two people who start out as enemies.Red Adam is everything she abhors in men: loud with the manners of a caveman and morals that are as low as a rock on the ground. Mistaken, he thinks she is bashful until she bites him. The description of these two going at it is so good you will think you are a fly on the wall in the room. And then she knocks him out with a stool.Unable to leave the room because his friends want their turn with her, she waits until Adam wakes up. And then they verbally go at it again, tit for tat. Until he tells her to bar the door after he leaves and he will marry her the next day.And so begins the unusual courting-after-marriage to earn Julitta's love. Ever so slowly, he earns her respect.

The Mauritius Command restores my faith in this series. It's a great tale of derring-do in the Indian Ocean, its based on some actual events and actual ships and overall the tone is very convincing. The women folk are left back on land, and only intrude to an acceptable level of letter writing etc. My (paperback) edition contains a valuable afterword by Brian Lavery who describes the actual ships on which the tale is based, and gives a worthwile overview of the seafaring terminology. I still won't be able to distinguish a fore topsail yard from a quarterdeck, but at least Lavery is reassuring that they are meaningful terms.Jack Aubery continues on his lucky career in the British Navy, almost - but not quite - achieving lasting fame and fortune; this being more necessary now that he has a wife, three children and a mother-in-law to support. For me, this book develops Stephen Maturin more - he is still secretive, reflective, reassuringly Irish and intellectual, however he develops a melancholia which is only temporarily suppressed by his furtive diplomatic activities. O'Brien moves Maturin one step closer to Sherlock Holmes by hinting at his opiate use during the story"

Following two families, this historic fiction offers insights into WWII that no textbook could. It opens in early 1939 and closes with Pearl Harbor, describing events in London, Europe, Washington and the Pacific. The book includes an enormous amount of factual data on actual events and individuals who played a significant role during the period. Additionally, it very effectively employs the device of reports written by a fictitious German general, to provide the German perspective on the war effort there. All in all an excellent book that should be required reading for anyone that feels they know too little about the period. And the sequel, War and Remembrance (which I am now reading) is an excellent follow up, continuing to track the characters throughout the remainder of the war."

There are over 2,600 reviews already and I doubt I'll be able to add anything new or groundbreaking. My mom and my friend have been trying to get me to read Water For Elephants for the past couple of years, but I've resisted. I didn't want to read this book for a few reasons, namely - the subject matter (a traveling circus) didn't really excite me, the idea of an old man telling the story in a sort of flashback manner reminded me too much of The Notebook (of which I only saw the movie), and most of all, I didn't want to read this story because I absolutely adore animals and I knew there would be parts about abuse that would be difficult for me to read. But now that the movie has come out, I knew it was time to give it a go. Books are always so much better than movies and I wanted to check this novel off my list before it possibly became tainted by Robert Pattinson's portrayal.... just in case. :)If, like me, you also have these reservations - don't let them stop you. Yes, the story is rather sad in parts, and it will make your heart break, but it's so much more. It took me a while to really get in to the story, but I absolutely tore through the last 200 or so pages. It's not so much a love story as it is a life story.You can really tell that the author did her homework. There are vivid, graphic descriptions of everything and you feel like you're right there with these characters. The true mark of a good writer (at least for me) is when they can create characters that you hate and abhor so much they can actually make your skin crawl even after you've read the last page. This author did that - and with more than one character.Overall, it was a fantastic story and I highly recommend it!"

Jacob talks about his past beginning with not completing his Vet Exams and finding himself in a travelling cirus during the Depression Era in America. Beneath the tinsel and cotton candy you find that the circus consists of hard men who never thought twice about throwing anybody from a moving train.There is brutality and violence in this book and also the search for dignity in this cold tough world. Naturally 5 stars for this book.

It was the best read I had had in a long time, and really enjoyed the unexpected turns and twists of the plot,(relentlessly surprising), and the richness of the scene descriptions and humble brillience of the indomitable main character.Just be sure you have enough time to read it all, because it is hard to put down!

But I'm a ""hard sell"" for fiction, and I can see by the other reviews that many people loved it. Lucky them!On a slightly more analytic level, I'd say that what prevented me from enjoying the book was the ""voice"" of the narrator, who is supposed to be a man in his nineties remembering his youth in the circus. I'm a man approaching seventy, with some circus experiences as a teenager in Iowa and as the father of a circus acrobat in the Cirque de Soleil era. I found the ""voice"" of the narrator unconvincing, extremely unconvincing, as a male of the species and as a male American of the 1930s and 1940s. I couldn't get past that central implausibility. I found myself scoffing at the sensibilities of the pseudo-male narrator at every emotional turn of this quite melodramatic novel."

Well, if you haven't read a lot of King you might think so, but Gray lacks the one thing that Kings excels at: building a sense of menace, fear and genuine &quot;creepiness&quot;. Much of this book alludes to this great big otherworldy evil, yet the payoff is disappointing. The basic idea is good - the passing of the runes to the &quot;victim&quot; who becomes the conduit for...well, I won't give it away, but believe me it's not really all that &quot;scary&quot; (if this book kept you from sleeping, you must scare quite easily). I agree with some of the other reviewers that the world of truckers seems an odd choice for a setting. Also, Gray's British vocabulary can be a bit distracting for the American reader (not that the book should be written to suit American tastes, but every time I read &quot;colour&quot; or &quot;odour&quot; it stops the narrative in its tracks) but spelling differences aren't as problematic as is the choice of terminology that no American (particularly a trucker) would use. There is a reference to a &quot;saloon car&quot; which is British for &quot;sedan&quot; but over here sounds like something out of a weird western. Same goes for &quot;Perspex&quot; which we Yanks know as &quot;Plexiglass&quot;. The plot &quot;twists&quot; aren't too believable either, particularly one character's complete mental turnabout after the character's true agenda is revealed. In fact, character development is lacking in general - for example, why is the elderly Asian man even in there? And not to nitpick, but it really does say &quot;Five Days Alive Permitted&quot; on the cover but the narrative (in more places than one) refers to &quot;Three Days Alive Permitted&quot; - a careless publishing error. To summarize - a good idea, but poorly executed."

Part of its appeal was the promise of a circus story. And the story was very realistic in some ways, detailing how difficult and unrewarding (not to mention very dangerous)that life could be.Some of the most interesting and moving parts of the book were actually those that took place in the nursing home that Jacob now lives in, remembering his youth with the circus. The author did a great job in describing the sadness, loneliness and other problems that befall the very aged. Especially those nearly forgotten by their families. Their cold treatment at the hands of people who barely see these elderly souls as human is all too real, having witnessed this myself when working in this type of facility. And another reason why I got out of nursing.The love story was so-so, and years were wrapped up too quickly, at least for my taste. I looked forward to more stories of Jacob as the circus veterinarian. There was alot of potential there for interesting and moving stories about the animals, but that aspect was barely touched upon. Rather it was more about Jacob's obsession with the beautiful Marlena.I loved many of the interesting characters, but always felt I did not quite know them in spite of their frequent appearances throughout the story. Walter the dwarf as an example. He was one of my favorite characters. I found myself wanting more of his own story, but it wasn't there.I would recommend this as a light summer read, but would not look for more than an interesting diversion and brief look into the world of the circus folk when the animals were still transported by train and when the circus coming to town was the biggest news of the month."

The books were as exciting as the series. I had purchased the four book package and when I finished it, there were too many gaps left open with no path for the reader to follow. Mr. Martin explained that there is a book 5 coming that is actually a parallel to book 4, as there was too much information to be presented.I definitely agreed that there were way too many holes and characters that you care about left hanging at the end. So, I looked forward to book 5, A Dance with Dragons.I have to say it was one of the worst endings to anything I have ever read. It was like "" I have to finish this, but don't know where to take it. Let's just kill off everyone and throw in more people!"". Except all the new characters are so disgusting you can't wait for the book to end. Characters that were so important to this series are dead and others that book 4 indicated were killed, seem to walk off happily together in book 5.I did see in the HBO Series, some movement in the second season that deviated from book 2. If there is any hope left, the producers will save Game of Thrones. If they stay on the path of the books, I fear all is lost. Maybe that is what Mr. Martin is trying to convey."

Having read other writers and other Dalrymple books on India before I set out, I read City of Djinns: A Year in Delhi first on my outward journey, and then reviewed it again as we made our way back to Delhi on the last stage of our tour. The book was an invaluable resource, supplementing the ill-informed and poorly spoken guides who were difficult to understand and unable to answer questions in any depth. Dalrymple's book helped me to tie the city and its sites and history together into some sort of coherent whole. I also found the pen-and-ink illustrations by Dalrymple's wife Olivia Fraser very illuminating. Although at first sight they struck me as much too calm and uncluttered to convey the true image of the places they posed, I later came to appreciate how they captured the inherent essence of their subject and spoke volumes in their simple way.As a journalist, Dalrymple has a knack for finding the right people to talk with - people with living memories of the time he writes about, who can bring to life the crumbling ruins they inhabit and instil us with visions of the beauty that once radiated in Delhi. It is certainly difficult to see today but reading the stories did help me to understand the sensibilities of some of the Delhi-wallahs we encountered in our travels.My one criticism of the book is that he reuses material that has appeared elsewhere, which broke the rhythm of my involvement with his story and made me feel uncomfortable. These passages were extensive, and not changed sufficiently to feel new in any way. I was surprised that his editors allowed this to pass, unless there were deadline difficulties.The overall impression that I was left with is that India today is still suffering from the reverberations of the devastation of partition, which brought incomprehensible tragedy and hardship and touched almost every family in India in one way or another. As we watch India vie for its place in the globalised technological marketplace, we will understand her better if we remember this recent back-story in her development."

This book is written with clear attention to detail and descriptions of what life very well may have been like with a train circus during Prohibition and the Great Depression. In addition to the day-to-day goings on there is the added element of several plot lines of a personal nature with feelings of love, loss, joy and sorrow. Each character is seen from Jacob's point of view and drawn so clearly that you feel you know them personally. I want Jacob to be my friend and so will you!Definitely a book I will be recommending to most everyone! I only wish there had not been the need for a few relatively explicit scenes as those few make this book unsuitable for my 11-year-old. She is a voracious reader and wants to be a writer.

She swung back and forth between the character's present drab life to the unpredictable depression era circus of his youth so naturally that I was amazed how often I forgot I was reading a book. I was so entranced by the scenery and story that it just flowed along like I was watching it, or more accurately, living it with the characters.

This was the second book I read this year and so far, it's the best book I've read this year but it isn't as good as the reviews say it is. I enjoyed the bits about the old man's life more than I did than when he talked about his youth. Left lurching in an oldage home, this man tries to fend for himself when he's made to sit with a fellow gentleman he doesn't quite like. The only thing the old man knows is that he's old and even goes as far as wishing that the reader never gets to this age. The introduction of the novel is very good and it's easy to read although at times when he's reminiscing, you may get confused. The names of animals and humans can be a tad confusing. This book is a good bet for some while I can think of some people not liking this.Fellow casual readers, you're not missing much, try Frank McCourt's Angela's Ashes. However, for those with piqued interests, you must be wondering why your friends never spoke about this book, I wondered so too, only until I finished reading the book.

I will say that the circus atmosphere was conveyed with incredible, and apparently accurate, detail and I was impressed by that. I could see and even smell everything, and the book movingly conveyed how desperate times led to desperate people clinging to even the most degrading employment with a third rate circus. However, the characters seemed to be straight out of a romance novel, with the exception of old(even he's not sure how old he is)Jacob, who was funny, disarming, feisty and touching -- whereas the young Jacob was pretty vanilla, too obviously a ""nice guy"" with little personality. In contrast, Old Jacob's voice was so clear and true and I really cared about him;he was funny and sad, his memories bittersweet, his longings compelling. I also liked (but who didn't?)Rosie the elephant, who had twice the personality of anyone else in the fleabag circus, with the exception perhaps of Walter, the dwarf. The plot depended on coincidences that I had problems believing, and I found myself caring more about the animals (which I admit isn't unusual for me!) than I did about any of the people. However, I'd heartily recommend this book to anyone who enjoys sentimental stories, who loves happy, pat endings, who doesn't necessarily want a book to convey great ideas, but who is touched more by the romance rather than the writing. Those of you will, as have many others, it appears, love this book. There is certainly nothing wrong with that, it's just that those kinds of books are simply not what I prefer to read. This book might actually make a good movie, and I'd be surprised if Hollywood hasn't snatched it up already."

Neither they nor the patchwork consortium of world powers who sent them could agree why they were there or what they wanted from Mars. To Phyllis, Mars was a geological treasure-trove for commercial usage. To Ann, Mars was a museum of geology to be preserved as much as possible in its natural state. To Sax, it was a laboratory for bioengineering experimentation; to Arkady, a laboratory for social reform. To Nadia, it was the supreme test of her genius for cold-weather engineering. To John Boone, the group's charismatic figurehead, it was the sum of what everyone else wanted it to be: he just wanted the First 100 to stand united. No one knew what Frank Chalmers wanted -- but whatever it was, John Boone stood in his way.Most fans of Red Mars rave about its scientific realism, but I've never cared one way or another about the technicalities of speculating plausible future technologies. Instead, I recommend this book for its broad epic vision, its believably complex political situation, and its portrayal of strong but flawed characters confronting difficult situations with ingenuity, hope, and courage. I particularly like the way Robinson explores the complex relationship between John Boone, the First Man on Mars, and his fame -- between a human being &amp; the legend that arose in his wake. The book isn't perfect -- some things the author seemed to be setting up don't pay off, and I could have done without having the most obnoxious character incessantly identified as a &quot;Christian&quot; -- but it's an absorbing, memorable adventure."

As a newly promoted commander in a small sloop, and even as a post captain, he was at the beck of more senior officers. Now, as commodore in command of a squadron of several ships-of-the-line and lesser warships, plus a small herd of transports and Indiamen crowded with troops, he has reached a position of high command, with orders to capture the French outpost islands of Mauritius and La Reunion in the Indian Ocean. As Dr. Maturin privately notes in his diary, Jack was probably happier as a junior officer, with only his own ship and men in his direct responsibility; now he must manage other ships's captains at one remove, deal diplomatically with the Army, and oversee the installation of a new British governor. O'Brian hews closely to historical fact in narrating this little-known but complex campaign, and he also delves more deeply into the psychology of the supporting characters -- especially Lord Clonfort, a not unintelligent but very unhappy young commander apparently afflicted with bipolar disorder, who constantly seeks the approval of his own subordinates as well as his seniors. As true historical fiction, this volume is, for me, the most enjoyable in the series yet."

These lengthy novels follow the trials and travails of one American family through the years immediately preceeding the Second World War through to the end of that war. The author does a great job of depicting the terrors of the holocaust and of the ground war on Europe's eastern front. Likewise pacific naval combat is dealt with on a personal level. The historical context of the books seemed to be quite accurate. By the close of the second book the reader will have an appreciation for the cost of global war. Personally, I could have done with somewhat less of the romantic double-dealings and intrigue. My only other caution to the prospective reader is the daunting length of these books.

The characters are as unsympathetic as they come, with the 2-D Maria who has probably never entertained a thought in her head, she is so stupid and empty, except to please Robert Jordan, who spends hundreds and hundreds of pages just thinking random thoughts, and walking from place to place. I thought that Anna Karenina was long and drawn out, but even at 800 + pages that book was less drawn out than this wprthless piece. It was completely unnecessary for it to be so long--one of Hemingway's short stories, about an old man on a bridge during the spanish civil war, at less than 3 pages is ten times more movign and poignant than this book. And it doesn't even really paint the Spanish civil war all that well--if you really want a glimpse of what it was like, go rent and watch the classic movie ""La lengua de los mariposas"" or ""Butterfly"" in English, which will give you a better idea and much mroe enjoyment at the same time. This book also isn't really that action-packed at all for a war book--I'd say fighting and battle takes up maybe two-fifths fo the book at the most, it's mostly just talking, long stories, long ten page thought streams of RJ, or just walking from place to place, describing things with some of the longest run-on sentences I've ever seen (anyone who tells you that Hemingway's style was just short and simple sentences is full of it in regard to this book).In short, this book is not worth your time--read one of Hemingway's short stories if you must, but not this long, drawn out, boring yarn."

The characters are wonderful, the depiction of an old time Circus and the life of those who were ""on the show"" is impressive.The book has two major flaws, in my opinion. First, the beginning of the book is a word for word copy of the most tense and climactic scene, and the entire novel is spent just knowing you're headed to that scene, so all the power of that moment is spoiled. A linear telling of the tale, start to finish, would have been much better.I'm not sure what was gained (if anything) by the dual voices of young and old narrator, but I suspect it was done for ""literary effect"". This is a very powerful tale of romance, the bonds between men and animals, passion, love - every time it shifts back to the present - it's like a deflating balloon.I wish the story had been told on it's own without the unnecessary shifting of voice and had actually had a climax remaining when the climax arrived...I recommend the book, but lament some of the choices the author made in presenting it."

Wouk strikes me as a talented writer, who employs all the technical tools of his trade-such as using letters, excerpts from a military analysis (fictional) to help lend depth to his characters and a framework for the events of the novel.Winds of War, in particular, grabbed me and by the end I was frantic to get to the sequel to find out what happens to the Henry clan. I agree with another reviewer who writes about the steady developement and changes to Byron and how believeable it is. A great read (both of them) I would also recommend for similar novels (albeit different periods) &quot;A Soldier of the Great War&quot; and &quot;Killer Angels&quot;One final note, you may want to pause b/w reading the two novels as I found towards the latter third of War and Remembrance that I was getting tired of the book, but I read the two back to back over the course of three weeks."

7,3.02,0.997,1990,05-03,4908500,Snappy Tomato Pizza,Ocala,,Temple,East,11,"Red Mars is good old fashioned &#34;hard&#34; science fiction where the author takes his science seriously and crafts a story that is a perfectly plausible extrapolation of current-day technology. It is also well informed and rich in depth on the political, social, and psychological levels. And, not least, it is a great epic story of exploration, conflict, love and loss.The story begins with the launching of the ship carrying the first permanent colonists to Mars. They are 100 scientists, engineers and specialists, mostly Americans and Russians, under United Nations jurisdiction. Even before they arrive, they have split into camps over the issue of whether and how aggressively they should attempt to modify the climate of their new home to make it more agreeable to human habitation. Eventually the decision is taken out of their hands as the multi-national corporations--the true villains of the novel--rush aggressively into the full-scale exploitation of the mineral-rich planet. As more colonists are rushed to the scene and living conditions deteriorate, a crisis looms.One of the strengths of the novel is the way the author tells the story from the perspective of different characters, in each case illuminating the situation according to that character's specialty or personality. Each chapter has its own protagonist, reflecting the focus of events at that time (e.g. scientific, technical, political, social, or interpersonal). Some readers may not care for the absence of a central sympathetic figure, but I think it is what make a novel of this scope move and inform as well as it does.Red Mars is the first of a trilogy, continuing with Green Mars and Blue Mars."

They did a number of adaptations for the screenplay that made it work better. Like August was the owner in the movie, but in the book he wasn't but he was in charge of the animals and Uncle Al was the owner. At any rate, the movie was made for a PG-13 rating and though there were some mild situations and language, it was tolerable, vs. the book, where there was a lot of swearing and a few lewd descriptions that weren't necessary for the story in order for it to be a good one. If not for the cheesy sexual stuff and multiple F-bombs dropped, I would have enjoyed the book more. The story itself is quite good, but the delivery of it was lacking because of the language and overly-detailed sexual situations. So if I were to recommend one, I'd tell people to choose the movie over the book. It's less crude, and ultimately, a more satisfying experience. The story structure itself reminded me a lot of The Notebook by Nicholas Sparks."

There are so many great things about this book, when you put it all together, it was just one of the best books I've ever read.The point of view for Water for Elephants is unique. Jacob, the main character, comes to us first as a 90 (or is it 93?) year old man who is living in a seniors home. Most of the story is Jacob recalling his life with the circus, with short trips back to his here-and-now. I felt that I came to know all of Jacob. From his beginning, losing his parents in an accident, to his experience with the circus and his true love, to his last days feeling trapped in a body and mind that he wasn't free to control himself any longer.With the story being set in the 1930's and in the Depression, the book was even more interesting to read about days in that era. At the end of the book, the author describes all of her research that she's done for her book. It's obvious by how thoroughly and well written Water for Elephants is.I highly, HIGHLY recommend this book!!!"

Great story, good characters, loved Rosie the elephant. Very thought provoking and I really adored the old carny photographs sprinkled throughout the book.

In his best piece, Old Man and the Sea, Hemingway describes a man's courage and conviction in a mini-epic struggle between and elderly man and the greatest catch of his life (a giant marlin). In another book, The Sun also Rises, Hemingway paints a very rich and colorful portraitt of Spain and Pamplona that I could not sum up in a few sentences. Both books create a vivid picture almost unequaled in literature.This book, however, does nothing of the sort. Excluding a side story that concerns the massacre of a town of locals, it is repetitive, boring, and provides little insight. The majority of this 450 page book takes place in one cave and provides very little substance. Personally, no picture was painted for me, no human character was exposed, and no real lasting meaning came from this book.I grew tired of the cave, tired of the speculation about killing the Guerilla leader Pablo, and bored of the lightweight, unreal romance. An editor could have spliced away pages 200-400, and the book would have not missed a beat.If you're a casual reader like myself, stick with other Hemingway works."

Instead, I am left thinking that perhaps, I should have read Twilight instead. The an essential problem of reading a romance in which the reader does not care for the romantic protagonists, is that it takes the heart out of the book.Though there was enough in the side characters, animals and atmosphere to carry the book but alas there I often found Gruen's phrasing annoying and clunky. I have decided in all fairness to Ms Gruen and her many fans that I will desist from reading any more of her works and we shall all continue on quite happily."

Same material set against a new backdrop.Sometimes a good read is just that - a good read. It doesn't have to be life-changing - just entertaining. I love how it was all told as a personal history.I do appreciate the author's exhaustive research to get the circus terms right. My only (small) complaint (and maybe I missed something) was that not all the terms were defined for the reader. It does not take away from the storyline at all."

6,3.18,0.99151,1987,09-28,6205600,Snappy Tomato Pizza Co,Hope,,DePaul,Midwest,3,"Have to say I'm wondering what all the fuss is about this book? Up to about page 190 I found it to be an enjoyable read and had mentioned it to friends. Alas from page 190 onwards I found it losing its grip...maybe it's too long?Most of the characters are underdeveloped to the point that much of the conversation between Jacob and the various circus folks could essentially take place between him and one other - they all sound the same. I've read peoples comments about the trials and tribulations of the characters living through the depression - it doesn't come anywhere close to a classic dealing with the same period, The Grapes of Wrath.The stampede at the end is a tad too contrived, surely the animals would be tearing themselves, and all around them, limb from limb given that they've attacked their handlers in the past. Same goes with Jacobs disappearance from the old peoples home - again too contrived.There is the makings of a great story here but I don't think Gruen is the one to tell it. The opening scenes have Blackie under the authority of Camel and then 3 months down the road Blackie is ejecting Camel from the train? Sorry it doesn't seem credible. August seems like a nasty piece of work but his paranoia was certainly well founded in the end; we're told that he suffers from paranoid schizophrenia but does anyone help him out with it? Just seems a convenient way for Gruen to add a villain in to the mix...and I have to question would circus folks even know what it was in the first place, and surely his wife would have helped him try and figure it out...""I left my husband""...""why?""...""he was a paranoid schizophrenic""...""ah, OK, cool""...isn't life a little more complicated than that? And his ultimate demise and how it was conducted is a little far fetched.I guess I'm feeling let down - the book starts off well but alas doesn't maintain the quality. Also found the interview with Gruen to impart nothing of much substance and the ""Questions for Book Groups"" to be of a nature beyond the level of this book - Grapes of Wrath certainly gives rise to concerns about the depression, compassion etc. but this book doesn't. Alas it didn't deliver and I don't think I'll be reading anything else by Gruen based on this.Have to say that I'm a little disgruntled at the thought of Gruen has a couple of dollars of mine and undeservedly so; if I was Gruen I'd be asking myself whether the ending was worthy of the potential shown earlier in the book. Unfortunately, it's books like this that have me buying books secondhand, and for the most part reading the ""classics""; they're classics as they've withstood the test of time - I can't imagine this book doing so. For authors I like I'm more than happy to buy a book new and in the process pay money to the author, but my disappointment with this book is such that I don't think Gruen deserves any reward for it and makes me realise what a financial risk one is making buying new books from untried authors.Why are there so few contemporary authors out there who are deserving of the praise that seems to be lauded upon them so easily these days? For those of you looking for a book that covers the darker aspects of humanity and their situations along with some wonderfully humourous moments then give ""Suttree"" a read by Cormac McCarthy - it's not the easiest of reads but rewards effort."
6,3.16,0.994,1990,04-17,5016800,Big Town Hero,Portland,,Santa Barbara,Southeast,9,"With its spotlight on elephants, Gruen's romantic page-turner hinges on the human-animal bonds that drove her debut and its sequel (Riding Lessons and Flying Changes)--but without the mass appeal that horses hold. The novel, told in flashback by nonagenarian Jacob Jankowski, recounts the wild and wonderful period he spent with the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth, a traveling circus he joined during the Great Depression. When 23-year-old Jankowski learns that his parents have been killed in a car crash, leaving him penniless, he drops out of Cornell veterinary school and parlays his expertise with animals into a job with the circus, where he cares for a menagerie of exotic creatures[...] He also falls in love with Marlena, one of the show's star performers--a romance complicated by Marlena's husband, the unbalanced, sadistic circus boss who beats both his wife and the animals Jankowski cares for. Despite her often clich&eacute;d prose and the predictability of the story's ending, Gruen skillfully humanizes the midgets, drunks, rubes and freaks who populate her book."

The book read like a treatment for a screenplay, in that it seemed less like a novel than an attempt to sell a script to Hollywood. The characters all sounded the same, and the dialogue was too modern for the time period of the novel.

This is my absolute favorite book, and I'll tell you why. As many reviewers have already pointed out, this book is enjoyable on so many levels: the characters are deep and complex; the questions about their purpose are deep.As a native Spanish speaker, I truly enjoy this book much more because Hemingway's prose is an exact translation of how the characters would speak in their Spanish setting, which I only realize now living in Puerto Rico and re-reading this masterpiece after many years (and two war tours). The conversations, which may seem awkward to a non-Spanish speaker, are perfectly natural if translated into Spanish, adding to the realism of his tale. Chalk this up to Hemingway's genius and his ability to create realistic worlds in which his characters live and die."

My only criticism is that perhaps the book could be a little longer. Still, it is one I highly recommend. These women did help pave the way for future women's sports."

I don't really like romance books all that much so it was awhile before I actually read this book but wishing now I had read it sooner! It was NOTHING like I thought it was going to be at all!This book is about a 93 year old man in a assistant living home that is recalling the time he spent in the circus as a young man after his parents got killed in a car accident. I was really expecting it to be more happy upbeat book about the circus but there was very little ""happy"" in this book! Some parts were so hard to read and I had to keep myself reading, not because the writing was bad or the book was bad but because some parts were just heart wrenching that it was hard to read without crying or at least on the verge of it, or wanting to go and kill August!The writing was amazing the author has amazing talents and I never expected the ending! I was actually fairly pissed off when Jacob didn't get to go to the circus and was thinking that I was going to be pretty upset with the ending but it caught me off guard and I ended the book smiling and crying at the same time.Amazing book read it!"

This story leads the reader into the rich and complex world of traveling circuses, circa 1930's. The journey of the young man reminded me of Clyde Griffiths in Theodore Dreiser's, ""An American Tragedy"", the relationship between Marlena and August reminded me of the dynamics between Sophie and Nathan in William Styron's, ""Sophie's Choice"".

The chapters then alternate between old Jacob and his very depressed state at the Assisted Living Facility and him remembering his journey with the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth. The circumstances on how he came to join the circus as the show Veterinarian were very sad. He went from being a young man about to graduate from Cornell, his whole future ahead of him and the possibility of FINALLY losing his virginity, to having no one and nowhere to go.Once on the show, he meets August, the show's equestrian director and superintendent of animals. August is one very questionable character. He can be the most charming man around and moments later he can turn into the most terrifying creature you've ever encountered. He also meets Marlena, August's wife, and falls in love with her on the spot. At a later point, the show aquires an elephant named Rosie who is thought to be stupid because she won't learn to do anything the trainers try to make her do. Rosie plays a huge part in this story, and she gave me the biggest surprise in this book. This story also takes you on an eye opening journey through the sad conditions circus employees and animals were under in 1931.Water for Elephants was a completely different read for me. It was Adult, and it was realistic, and I loved it. I was a little skeptical about the circus theme. Can't say I've ever been curious enough about its workings to read a book revolving around one, but I am so glad I did because it was sooo much more than that! It made me laugh, cry and gasp in astonishment sometimes. It was a huge plus knowing this will be a movie (coming out in April) starring Robert Pattinson and Reese Witherspoon as the main characters. I just pictured both of them the whole time! :D"

7,3.45,0.9923,1999,08-13,5959200,Two Mammas' Vegan Kitchen,Oakland,,St Johns,South,3,"This novel is considered by most to be one of the great novels of the 20th Century, and its author to be one of the greatest authors of all time; there are undoubtedly reasons for this. Yet, Hemmingway is also considered to be a &quot;love him&quot; or &quot;hate him&quot; type. I tend toward the former, though he isn't one of my personal favorites.The plot of this novel is relatively straightforward. American Robert Jordan, a member of the International Brigades fighting with the Republicans against the Fascists during the Spanish Civil War, is given the task of blowing up a bridge to prevent the Fascists from bringing up reinforcements to repel a Republican offensive. But while the plot is uncomplicated, the depth and breadth of Hemmingway's story telling are not. There are layers and layers of emotion, passion, and personal pain. You are transported to the mountains of Spain with Jordan and a band of Spanish guerilla fighters. The characters are so incredibly real, that you feel as though you could find their names in a history book. For those who have never read Hemmingway, I'd say give it a try."

I really felt the genuine desperation of the Prohibition and the Depression. The 1920s/30s traveling circus was interesting and well-researched. Also the passages in which Jacob is 90 or 93 years old were beautifully written and very believable.The not-so-good: The author often devoted long passages to the mundane and then just jumped over the parts of the story that a reader wants to spend time on (such as key dialogue between the main characters which would provide the reader with their back stories and develop a genuine love story)...which brings me to:The bad: the characters are, for the most part, one-dimensional and the character dynamics and relationships are unrealized and unbelievable. At its core, this is a romance and yet I never understood how and why the two characters fell in love. They meet and next thing I know, they are in love."

Yes, the science of terraforming Mars is intriguing, but all too simplistic in Robinson's account. The characters are paper thin and for the most part ANNOYING. The only real character is conveniently disposed of just as an actual plot was developing. The only reason I will finish this is is out of a hope that Frank, Maya, Hiroko and the rest of the annoying lot will somehow meet a cruel and painful death at the hands of Ray Bradbury and Edgar Rice Burroughs at the end.

I didn't take that much from that chapter, but simply that the verdict isn't really out on Milk. I think he would have done better to address the question of raw or pasteurized--another big subject of debate. But, that logically must come from the belief first that milk is good for you and I didn't really feel that he made a decisive decision about it though he leaned more towards milk than away from it.There were several things I enjoyed about this book. I enjoyed learning a lot of nutritional history--like the history of vitamins and how different things in our food (like canola oil) were developed. There were also interesting chapters about various vitamins. I now finally understand why there are vitamins B6 and B12, but not B7 and B8 (they were originally named and then discarded because people realized they had no nutritional value). There was a very interesting (to me) chapter about detox diets and the lack of scientific evidence that they do any good. In fact, there is no evidence that there are health benefits to them.But, the reason I haven't given it 4 or 5 stars, is that the author leans heavily towards the opinion that chemicals in our food is just fine. Even given his scientific evidence, I am not fully persuaded. Many of the things he talked about haven't been around for years, so we don't know their long term effects. It was just this year that several reports were published stating that artificial sweeteners are digested the same as regular sugar and do not contribute to weightloss. Which, by the way, I was very surprised that he didn't talk about Splenda at all but he did talk about other artificial sweeteners. I did notice after another reviewer mentioned it that studies are mentioned, but not footnoted or identified in an appendix at the back of the book."

This book came at a very confusing time for me : I wasn't satisfied with my service and thought of other options ,one of them was the Israel Marine Commando - our version of the Navy Seals. This book actually had helped me make up my mind to dismiss this option. Don't get the wrong impression. It's a must read .The first 100 pages are the best I've ever read. The story is so thrilling ,it's hard to put it down .It made me realize how terrible the status of the women in our society was and still is. I actually cried out loud in pain while reading . Those days were exetremly violent in Israel ,every monday and thursday I'd read about a woman being slaughter ,and felt the urge to do something ,to fight those killers,to punish them like Kelly punished the murderer in the book. In regard to the Commando dilemma ,I realized they make a killer out of a man. I descided I don't wanna kill anybody . It's not my way.

It's the first book for a book club my two best friends in NYC and I are starting, and we gave ourselves a month to finish it. Two of us have completed it less than a week after it was assigned.The book tells the story of Jacob, now old, reminiscing about his life as part of a circus. It's an easy read, and no literary feat by any means, but it's a good read all the same. Its 300-plus pages fly by, and in them, you begin to feel like you're a part of the circus, understanding what it's like to work behind the scenes. It discusses the meaning of love, towards both humans and animals, and honour: what do you owe the people around you?The parts I loved best, though, and that touched me the most weren't the love story: I've seen too many of its kind before. No, it was the discussion of aging that got to me and made me cry so hard in the last two pages I woke my boyfriend up: what does it mean to age? What does your family owe you as you age? And what does your life mean when you're ninety-something, in a nursery home, and alone except for your memories? These questions terrify me: they wrack me with guilt and fear, and in raising them, this book became something more than a beach read. I don't think I'll think of Rosie too much, or Bobo; I don't think I'll remember Jacob or Marlena too often, either.

I got about halfway through before it became too boring. More recently, I tried reading it again from the beginning and got less than halfway through.The main problem with Red Mars is that the author finds it necessary to put in an excruciatingly large amount of detail in everything. From describing procedures the astronauts use to descriptions of the Martian environment. A certain amount of detail is nice and helps create a vivid image, but I am not an astronaut-in-training so all the excessive technical detail should have been avoided.In my own opinion, pretty much every character in the book is annoying. I found some of them rather flat. They seem intent on talking politics (read: the author's political beliefs) or getting themselves into love triangles and wondering what went wrong. This does not help when the story shifts from one character to another when it is hard to like any of them.The book teeters on the edge of complete implausibility. I can believe the technology used to get the First Hundred to Mars, but the fun ends there. First, we are led to believe that space agencies would be so mind-blowingly incompetent as to send a bunch of under-qualified astronauts on a long-term mission to Mars. Later in the book (and I do not think I am spoiling much here), the colonists come up with a plan to use a bunch of wind-powered heaters to increase the overall temperature of Mars. Nonsense.I had hoped to read the entire trilogy as an epic story about colonizing and terraforming Mars. Instead I never made it more than halfway through the first book. If you want some real science fiction, go read some Clarke. This book did nothing for me."

The reason is that Flashman and the Redskins is really two books in one: one recounting Flashman's exploits as a '49er, scalphunter and adopted Apache, and another with his involvement in the Battle of the Little Bighorn. The two stories are self-contained and only tertiarily connected, and there's little need for them to be compiled into one volume.After opening with an aged Flashman putting down a soppy idealist bemoaning the fate of the Native Americans - Fraser at his most pointed, irreverent and funny - the first half is a direct sequel to Flash for Freedom, with Flashman and Latin-spewing slaver John Charity Spring fleeing the law, going to California with a New Orleans madam and a wagonload of whores. The first half is Fraser at his best, with intricate plotting, colorful characters (particularly the ghoulish scalphunters), exciting action, pleasant bawdiness, a vivid description of places and events and Fraser's usual acidic humor. Flashy's exploits in New Mexico would stand alone as one of the best in the series, if Fraser had left well-enough alone.The second half of the book, on the other hand, is pretty much useless. The Battle of Little Bighorn has been covered in numerous films, books and other works, and Fraser adds little to the littany of Custer-related literature. Indeed, with Flashman flitting back and forth between the Indians and Cavalry, it smacks more than a bit of Little Big Man. The ties to the first part - mostly through Flashman's spurned lover Cleonie - are poorly done, and Flashman's illegitimate son is tacked on as a mere plot contrivance.My biggest problem, though, is that there's no need for the second half. Flash For Freedom! covered a great deal of time and space, but all the events were connected - improbably, but believably, through intricate, detailed plotting and related events and characters. Flashman at the Charge was less successful, covering too much time and space, but at least there was flow and connection between scenes. The leap of twenty-seven years here is a cheat, and since each Flashman book is essentially self-contained, its inclusion is inexplicable. It should have been published separately, if at all."

When I read in Entertainment Weekly the Reese Witherspoon and Robert Pattison would be starring in the film adaptation of Water for Elephants, I knew that I had to pick it up. I rarely pay full price for a book. However, this one had such rave reviews that I couldn't help myself. Still, it sat on my bookcase until this week when I promised to read it before the opening of the movie. Honestly, I was greatly disappointed.Sara Gruen tells the story of Jacob Jankowski who is so distraught after his parents' deaths that he runs away with the circus. He leaves between his education at Cornell University and his future as a veterinarian. Fortunately, his study of veterinary medicine helps him land a job as the circus' vet. While touring with the circus he meets a number of characters from a red haired midget clown, to an old circus worker who is struck with ""jake walk"" (a condition brought on by drinking tainted whiskey). Jacob soon discovers that life on the road is beyond trying. When an elephant is brought on as part of the show, Jacob finds himself torn between his job as a compassionate vet and the rules of the circus. This causes Jacob to bump heads with his boss, August, who is beyond temperamental and at times masochistic. To complicate matters, Jacob is in love with the lead actress of the show, Malena, who just happens to be August's wife.While the subject matter of the circus would seem to be incredibly interesting, this novel was boring from start to finish. The entire plot was cliched, the relationships were shallow, and the characters were without depth. From the first chapter, I knew the exact path that the novel was going to take. Every time I thought to put the book down, I convinced myself to give it one more chance. It was after all a bestseller, therefore, I thought it would get better. It never did. If anything, it got worse as every cliche was reinforced. The only twist came at the very end and was so absurd I had to re-read the last few pages three times over to make sure that I read it correctly. A book is only as good as its character development but in this novel there is no development. Though Jacob attempts to mature, he can't seem to figure out what his priorities are. Incidentally, neither can Gruen for she has Jacob bemoan his conflicting emotions between his love for Marlena and his feelings towards animal abuse. Fortunately for Jacob, the animals take their fate into their own hands which relieves Jacob of having to develop. I hope, for the box office's sake, that the movie fails to resemble the book. Either way, I will not be the first in line at the theater."

This is the longest of his novels though the easiest to describe. The Hemingway style is not as lean as in earlier works, one might even say it is pleasantly plump in comparison (as Papa himself was at the time of writing). I'll never forget my first reading of this book. One of those books you put down and just hold your breath with the memory of it all. This might best be described as Hemingway fare for non Hemingway fans. Though Hemingway fans like it too, but it will always be number three to them. The Sun Also Rises is perhaps one of the more difficult books to summarize and Hemingway's style is so new in it that the book created a buzz that has still not died down. What was not said in that first book left some feeling a bit famished. Others were intrigued by this new kind of writing that held its cards so close to its chest. In this book you get a more conventional novel of a novel though the events described in it are very powerfully told. (It is fun to see pictures of Hemingway as a reporter at this time. A world famous novelist in the field.) This book along with A Farewell to Arms prove no American knew better how to convey by written words that nasty busines of war better than Hemingway. Robert Jordan is one of the least talked about Hemingway characters ever. Perhaps because he is a character invented to serve a plot. You will love this book of fighting and love in the Spanish mountains. John Donne himself I think would have proudly read and enjoyed this."

A tour-de-force of story-telling in the fantasy genre!Daenerys Targaryen, the silver-haired dragon princess, finds herself ruling the savage lands known as ""Slaver's Bay"". Jon Snow, the bastard Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, unwittingly creates discension among the ranks of the ancient brotherhood. And the kinslayer Tyrion Lannister, on the run from bounty hunters, makes his way across Essos, hoping to find and to serve the Targaryen princess. Through the trials and the hardships of these three main characters, the story unfolds. And what a story it is! Plots are resolved, while new ones develop. Characters die, new ones are introduced. Chaos and unrest are on the rise in both East and West. Slaves dream of freedom. Magical abilities increase. The three dragons (Drogon, Rhaegal, and Viserion) continue to grow stronger, and wilder. The supernatural threat from the far North makes itself more prominent as the long winter approaches. And the freedom-loving savages known as the Wildlings have come down from the far North to settle below the Wall. While the eunuch, Varys, continues to create his own brand of disorder within the capital city, King's Landing. Cersei, daughter of the great house of Lannister, continue in her inept rulership of the Seven Kingdoms. Meanwhile, players big and small continue to play the game of thrones.As in the previous volumes, the story is told through character point of views. While this gives you intimacy with those particular characters, non-major characters tend to remain an enigma. Not every reader will appreciate this type of narrative, I'm afraid. But if you can deal with it, I think you are in for a long love affair with A Song of Ice and Fire.I don't think this humble reviewer will need to work very hard to sell you on this book. The previous volumes and the new HBO television series speak for the novel. It goes without saying that anyone wishing to read this novel should only do so after reading the previous four that preceded it. If you are already a reader and would like to join a community of others to share your thoughts, theories, and ideas with, be assured that there are plenty of online communities out there dedicated to the series. Towerofthehand.com is one of the more popular sites, along with Westeros.org."

In this book, Hemingway speaks from the point of view of a third person omniscient narrator, that is, the narrator sees into the minds and emotions of all the characters from whose point of view the story unfolds. In this way Hemingway demonstrates his genius for having accurate and sensitive insight into the human spirit.I am impressed by the way he is able to express passion, especially in the sex scenes, under the constraints of early 20th century censorship. I read this book simultaneously with Sandra Brown's ""Hello Darkness,"" reading six chapters of Hemingway to every five chapters of Brown so that I would finish both books at the same time. This truly provided a contrast of how human passions were expressed in early 20th century novels compared with how they are expressed today. You should try it! It's an eye-opener! What some would judge as repetitive prose in Hemingway was actually a literary device he used to bring the reader into the experience, and in my opinion (and of course, the opinions of countless other readers and critics) Hemingway succeeds famously. I also found it very amusing to read how Hemingway skirted around the expression of ""unprintable"" language, a hindrance contemporary authors no longer need to be concerned about &lt;g>Another device Hemingway uses in this novel is to make his characters ""think"" in Spanish but ""speak"" in English. This is not easy to accomplish successfully. Because I am bi-lingual, I found the rhythm of the prose quite natural, but I wonder how the experience would be for an only-English speaking reader.This is my second Hemingway novel and I am so grateful that I have been introduced to Hemingway on Kindle. Because I read this on Kindle for PC, I was able to conveniently and quickly look up not only the definitions of words I did not know but also the translations of Spanish phrases with which I was unfamiliar. Thank you, Kindle! It made reading this book much more interesting and informative. It has also spurred an interest in the history of the Spanish Revolution which took place in the decade before I was born. Of course, Kindle has satisfied that curiosity as well.This is more than a worthwhile read for anyone who enjoys war novels. One learns so much from reading; I've always said fiction is the best medium for speaking truth, and Truth (whatever that means to each one individually) abounds in this book. Enjoy!"

All those yarns at loose ends are just left fluttering.Yes, that's correct. No satisfying conclusion awaits and about two dozen NEW characters are added instead, as if the author got tired of the old ones from the first four books and rather move along and then wrap up their stories he just ignored them completely. Not sure which is more disgusting, the sloppy and tedious writing or the utter disrespect to the readers he's dragged along through thousands of pages previously only to arrogantly leave hanging...as if we are all going to rush out for his next book to get what we didn't in this one.

Jacob Jankowski tells his story both in the form of memories while in a nursing home, and as the real time experiences of a 23-year old failed veterinary student in the midst of the Depression. Failing his exams, Jacob flees home and hooks up with a circus; he survives in this brutal world only because he has some skill with animals. Gruen paints a marvelous, completely believable portrait of a circus of the thirties, where the ruthless Uncle Al rules with the power of life and death. He deviates from planned appearances only to pick up the pieces of other failed circuses. Once someone ceases to be of use to the show, or if the money doesn't roll in as planned, they're gone--sometimes forever. It's a harsh world, but apparently historically accurate. And the old black and white photos at the beginning of each chapter are fascinating! Gruen's meticulous research makes the book--the plot line is a bit predictable and the ending a fantasy. But this is a great summer or airplane read--engrossing but not too heavy. Highly recommended."

I was not disappointed. This is the story of a man who is looking back on his life and how his actions helped him become the man he became. After the death of his parents he jumps a freight train only to discover it is a circus train. He was one exam away from becoming a veterinarian at the time of his families death and his time with the circus not only helped form his view of the world but also his view of mankind and himself. It was moving, the characters were 3 dimensional and grew during the telling of this tale. I couldn't put it down. The ending was very unexpected and I found myself wondering when it was all said and done what happened next. Although this was not in a genre I normally read I would highly recommend it. I am an animal lover and his compassion for the beast that were used by the circus was very touching. I found myself routing for the good guys and hating the bad guys and thinking to myself I could so see myself doing that. There are things that happen in everyone's life that shape them, change them and help them become the people they are meant to be.

However, we all knew this years back and this should have not been a surprise to fans of aSoIF. We all knew 'A Feast for Crows' and 'A Dance with Dragons' were actually suppose to be one volume but was split up due to size (but let's be honest it's probably due to $ also). So to go into this book and expect something different is totally insane. It's like opening a can of CocaCola and expecting it to taste like Dr Pepper! To penalize this book's quality/rating because of this is unfair. If 'A Feast for Crows' and 'A Dance with Dragons' came out in back to back years this would not even be an issue.I agree with most fans that GRRM is taking way too long to finish this series, the first book came out in 1996 so it's 16 years and counting as of this review! Perhaps if he didn't get sidetracked with so many side projects he would have finished years earlier. The gaps are so long in between each book that I have to lookup Wikipedia what happened in the last book. GRRM is doing himself and his series a disservice with his slightly faster than snails pace writing because people have lives and as time goes on so do our interest and attention span.Now onto this book's review, it once again showed why GRRM is truly a great story teller and how much time and effort he puts into the complexity of characters and storyline. I won't spoil it for those who haven't read it yet but there's a character who we hate because he betrayed the Starks (in book 2) and yet in this book we root for him to escape his captors. This character supposedly really 'Reeks'. A good writer will make the reader feel engaged and emotionally invested in the story and characters and GRRM does that better, if not the best, than many current authors. This book does move the story along for other characters such as Tyrion (my favorite) and what happened to him since he murdered his father. It just doesnt move the story along in terms of the entire series but hey that's not you were expecting right?"

Why did Marlena fall in love with Jacob? What made him stand out so much? It sounds bad that i say that, but I just didn't feel a spark between the characters. The whole damsel in distress was manufactured. Additionally, it was super convenient the way they ended up together in the end.

A Dance with Dragons was a long time coming but the wait was worth it.About half of the main characters were missing from A Feast for Crows, so I thought that Dance would show the same period of time from different viewpoints instead of advancing the story. This is not the case.About 1/4th of Dance overlaps with the previous novel. After that the overall plot advances and takes some interesting turns. Characters absent from Feast such as Jon Snow and Tyrion tell the majority of Dance, but Jaime, Arya, and others also have a few chapters.Martin has not dropped the ball.

Of course, this is not a book on the full history of Japan waging aggressive wars in Asia with her European axis friends. It presents the facts to prosecute the Class A, B, C war criminals with only 7 convicted to die by hanging by the international team of judges.However, due to international politics, it was reported in this book,the chief puppet responsible for waging aggressive wars, breaking peace and waging war against humanity was shielded and other war crime criminals were spared. Some topics were under-covered such as the pursuit of nuclear weapons, conducting biological experiment on POWs and kidnapping women as sex slaves. The court focused more on China, especially from Mukden Incident (September 18 1931), ten years before Pearl Harbor. It quoted Takashi Nagase, an English interpreter with the POWs, ""I can tell you that the conditions for the POWs who worked on the bridge were much worse than depicted in that movie (The Bridge on the River Kwai)"" (p.260). Many of the war criminals escaped justice and returned to civilian lives afterwards and many still hang on their pre-war logic of imperialism and militarism testified by Tojo and company.Different from the Nazi counterpart, the convicted and executed war criminals by Tokyo Trial, regarded as royal imperial warriors, were secretly enshrined Tokyo Yasukuni Shrine with annual homage by officials and soldiers who preach to whitewash, distort and deny the court record of Rape of Nanking.

To this reader, not a very compelling premise, yet once I read the first paragraph I was instantly hooked. By the second chapter, I had grown so attached to the main character that I truly felt for the things that happened to him. The story is told in rich, vivid prose, capturing each character so well that they soon became my friends and enemies, depending on the character. This book addresses a wide range of human experiences in a tasteful manner in which this reader was left in a pensive, awe-struck mood contemplating far more important questions and ideas about human existence.

The story is extremely well written, with details that enabled me to picture how everything appeared in a big top circus during that time. You immediately connect with Jacob from the start as his journey continues, pulling for him page after page. The other characters are well written with the story, feeling the happiness, joy and sadness each of them feel as the story continues.It's really hard not to say too much without giving the story away.

Supposedly about the Spanish Civil war, but no explanation was given. I used Wikipedia to explain the factions. Boring were the endless pages about Russian involvement. My Russian professor in college--circa 1953-54--was there, having been sent to teach the guerrillas Spanish history. ""They knew it. From oral history.""Hemingway wrote much of his dialogue to reflect the Spanish language, using the singular ""thee"" and ""thou"" to signal respect or disrespect, love, tenderness, and the plural ""you"" to show authority, etc.Substituting the noun ""obscenity"" repeatedly for verba was ridiculous. I assumed the publisher was responsible for this censorship. I might be wrong. Hemingway did not avoid the F-bomb or the A-bomb when he frequently wrote in Spanish (""joder"" and ""cabron,"" respectively).The amount of internal dialogue was both good and bad, the latter being excessive unless you read it carefully. The thoughts were real and showed internal conflict related to someone's doubts while in warfare. Artemos, a beloved older, religious character asks himself whether there is a difference between killing a human and and hunting animals. Has he sinned against his religion or God when he kills people during war? Is he forgiven when peace comes again?The love scenes between the protagonist (Robert) and Maria are unlike those popularly devoured in romance novels. On one hand, they are corny. On the other, they focus on whether two intimate people become one during life and after death, whether they are one even when they are apart from one another.There is no doubt that there is repetition--whether necessary or unnecessarywill be up to you to decide.Get the book, read it, and try to understand what Hemingway was saying or trying to say.Barbara C.

The love story left something to be desired. Does anyone understand where exactly that came from? One minute he sees her across a crowded room and then bang!she just happens to love him too. Okay then, don't bother to really get to know each other. Some of the characters were hardly developed, Marlena mainly. There were moments I found to be quite crude and crass. However, somehow I know that years from now I will look back at this read fondly.My best guess is that I just liked the voice found throughout the novel. In fact I would go so far as to say the narration was superb. I have always been a fan of first person and while the bulk of this story is in fact first person, Gruen superbly weaves a sort of third person narration. The transitions are so smooth that you barely notice the shift. Gruen is just a superb narrator or maybe it's Jacob who does the great job?Now for a few thoughts on the film; I have four words, don't waste your time. If the narration and not the actual story is what makes the book then it is a no brainer that a movie would fall very short. This film was really not good, at least from where I was sitting. Maybe it has to do with the major lack of chemistry between Witherspoon and Pattinson?"

Old-timey Jacob Jankowski is ten times funnier in the book, than he is in the film (I own both). I was able to appreciate the differences between the book & movie, and think that both are equally sturdy in entertainment value. I loved the bonus features of the book which included actual circus pictures & an interview with Sara Gruen, discussing her writing process, in the end. The only disappointment I had, was that the pictures were really small on my Kindle, so you couldn't always see them clearly. I have no idea what they look like in the actual book, but it would've been nice (for the Kindle version, at least) to dedicate one full page, or half a page to the circus pictures. This book also got me a lot more interested in the ins & outs of the circus industry in the 1930's & 40's... I also wonder if any of those same practices & rumored practices continue today. This book was very thought provoking & entertaining. I didn't want the story to end!"

In his best piece, Old Man and the Sea, Hemingway describes a man's courage and conviction in a mini-epic struggle between and elderly man and the greatest catch of his life (a giant marlin). In another book, The Sun also Rises, Hemingway paints a very rich and colorful portraitt of Spain and Pamplona that I could not sum up in a few sentences. Both books create a vivid picture almost unequaled in literature.This book, however, does nothing of the sort. Excluding a side story that concerns the massacre of a town of locals, it is repetitive, boring, and provides little insight. The majority of this 450 page book takes place in one cave and provides very little substance. Personally, no picture was painted for me, no human character was exposed, and no real lasting meaning came from this book.I grew tired of the cave, tired of the speculation about killing the Guerilla leader Pablo, and bored of the lightweight, unreal romance. An editor could have spliced away pages 200-400, and the book would have not missed a beat.If you're a casual reader like myself, stick with other Hemingway works."

I just *don't know*! Wading through page after page with no pay-off. Why and wherefore? Boy, it *sure* is COLD!! Um, yeah.So, I cannot in good faith recommend it.

He decides to hop a train and ends up in the middle of the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth. The Great Depression was just in its early stages so for Jacob having a paying job was lucky but he also found parts of the circus life to be a living hell. As he was just shy of his degree, Jacob ends up being put in charge of the menagerie, the starring animals of the show.He then meets Marlena, the beautiful equestrian act star who happens to be married to August, the twisted and manipulative animal trainer for the show.Uncle Al, the big boss of the Benzini Brothers, makes a habit of visiting other circus shows that fold and go under. There he has his pick of their performers and animals. It is at one such place that he picks up Rose, an untrainable elephant. He hopes her to be the savior of this traveling show that struggles a bit to keep up with Ringling Brothers, the top of the line. Jacob finds an instant connection with Rosie and the show and his life start to change.The book alternates between Jacobs time with the circus and his ""present"" time where he is 90 (""or maybe 93""...as he can't quite remember) and in an assisted living home. A circus has come to town and is visible out of the windows of the home. No one knows Jacobs past at the home when a new resident comes along and claims he carried water for the elephants in the circus when he was younger. This kind of woos the ladies and makes Jacob (who is much the curmudgeon by this time in his life) very upset and sets off a string of trouble for him at the home.The prologue when read at the beginning of the book very much drew me in to the story. When the same story makes its appearance toward the end of the book it is amazingly powerful. You'll just have to read it for yourself to truly see what I'm talking about.You can really tell that the author has a love of the circus and has done her research to bring the most accuracy she can to this tale. I honestly thought when I heard about this book from everyone that it was really not my cup of tea. I'm not one to just read love stories...I have to have some kind of conflict or suspense or something along those lines to keep my interest. That being said, this book does not lack for anything. It is really a great read and I would suggest giving it a shot even if you are having doubts about whether you will love it or not.

Even some of Wouk's numerous minor characters are capable of riveting his readers' imagination. Under the war's pressure, the leading characters undergo great change, and the reader will be kept in suspense until the very last page to see what becomes of them.In addition to a taut, thrilling narrative, the books present fascinating examinations of political, military and philosophical history as the characters struggle to make sense of their quickly changing worlds. As the story progresses, religion plays an increasingly important role. Wouk is an orthodox Jew, and his Jewish characters in particular wrestle deeply with their identities. Discussions between characters involve the nature of European history, the Jewish people, how Americans see the world, and how the world sees America. The historical research that informs these discussions is truly impressive (at the very end Wouk makes clear the degree to which the story is fabricated, and it is surprisingly slight).Besides relating numerous military (particularly technical ones) aspects of the war, Wouk takes a hard look at many aspects of American and allied policy, raising questions still unresolved regarding many controversial policy choices. He also strives to explore and explain the German mindset and viewpoint, using devices such as a fictitious German general's war memoirs to great effect. Wouk uses his characters and dialogue to explore in great detail how something as terrible as the Nazi regime and the Holocaust could have happened - how a supposedly civilized advanced European state could have perpetuated it and how supposedly civilized, advanced nations could have allowed it. Technology also plays a vital role in these stories - both good (e.g., sonar) and bad (e.g., those involved in the extermination of Europe's Jews) and one of a much more ambivalent nature: atomic power.There are minor flaws in these works to be sure. Pug Henry can be a little too omniscient when it comes to military affairs. This is best understood as necessary to his role as narrator and voice of the author rather than an accurate portrayal of a naval officer. Digressions and technical discussions become more common and longer in the second volume and the battle analysis in the fictitious German ""memoirs"" can drag, slowing the riveting narrative. Of course, what might bore one reader may captivate another.In sum, there is no more enjoyable and engaging way to explore the events that shook the world from the mid-1930s until the end of World War II than reading these two masterpieces. While not every book can ever appeal to every reader, these come as close as possible."

If I told you anything else, it would ruin something.This book is just about the best novel I've ever read. It is the most realistic novel written about the colonization of Mars (and there really have been a great many about that subject). The science and politics are believable and the characters are developed to a level that I have not seen since the some of the great American classics.This book is truly a pillar in science fiction writing and is an incredible start to the series. I read it in two sittings, which, for a 700+ page book, is really a feat. If you like Robinson and are interested in Mars, this book is a MUST read.If you are concerned why others did not rank the book so highly it is probably because they might have been expecting more action or the highly descriptive paragraphs about the Martian landscape, science and technology, and characters used in the novel bored them. If you do not find these things interesting, then the book might not be a 5 star (it might be a 4 star...or a 3 star if you just want some light reading), but I believe that these attributes add to the depth of the novel and its overall quality. It is not a light read or action-packed, like Dune, but it doesn't have to be. It's just an incredible book."

The way Gruen writes about the older character seemed so very well done. Even though I am not old, I felt older reading those passages. Gruen moves back and forth from present day to the past very smoothly and it is always a seamless transition for the reader. Great story, good characters, loved Rosie the elephant. Very thought provoking and I really adored the old carny photographs sprinkled throughout the book. Never thought I would enjoy a depression era book, but this one was really well done."
6,3.16,0.99557,1992,05-05,4056800,Luca's Villa Pizza,Bloomington,,Wake Forest,West,9,"This review is written for Winds of War, and War and Remembrance together. Although two separate books, they are really two halves of the same story, and really need to be considered together. These books may not be Mr. Wouk's finest books, but they are his finest story, and most encompassing work.These books really can be read for three different reasons: First, as a story of a family, and to effects of World War II. Second, as a war story of Sailors in World War II. Third, as a comprehensive history of World War II.This book is a story of a family. It tells of a husband and wife, their three sons, and their daughter, as well as all the love interests involved with these characters. Throughout the two books, we follow the all of these characters, as they interact with each other, and those around us. We get to see the effects of the war on their personal and professional lives, as well as the effects of the war on their relationships.This book is a war story. Many of the characters are directly involved in the war was U.S. Navy Sailors in the war. Most of those characters that are not serving in the military, are still directly involved in the war as diplomats, war correspondents, and other direct or indirect participation. We see many of the major battles, as well as some of the inner workings of politicians and diplomats.Finally, this book is a comprehensive history of World War II. Mr. Wouk puts a comprehensive treatise on World War II from the perspective of a German military officer between narrative chapters. Additionally, because many of the character are involved with the politics and diplomacy of the war, we get a view of the way it affected society as a whole, and the purpose of individual battles.Finally, one last note of caution. This book is a powerful book. It takes place in World War II, some of these characters are Jewish, some of these characters are serving in the military. Some of these chapters will be sad. This book is still amazing and worth reading, but should be approached with this in mind."

This series has become akin to a movie that I heard was good, and started off good, but turned out to be bad, but I just keep watching either because I expect it to get better, or I have already invested so much time in it.I cannot understand why this would merit 5 stars from anyone other than those making money off of it. To me 5 stars makes it one of the all time best books I have ever read, one that I will reread again and again because it is so entertaining, one that I think fondly of, or causes me to think in new ways, or inspires me to change my life. How can this book be any of those things to anyone, even to the author?At most I would think it should get 3 stars, but that would only be due to it being part of a larger series. By itself it should get one star, if that.The only redeeming feature of the book is the cliffhanger at the end, but if that situation turns out bad (character dies) then my interest in this series as a whole will die along with him."

He's currently in a nursing home. What's amazing is how she takes you inside his head and causes you to see events through his eyes, and his mind. You feel his frustration, his loneliness, and how he's misunderstood.Older people in the home are treated like children, but inside, they're cognizant, at least some of the time, and resent this treatment, but are helpless to prevent it.The details in the circus era are very well written. You're taught a lot about circus life, the fun, the dangerous, the dark underbelly. Maybe it's not representative; it is fiction, but you believe it. She takes you there.One of the most enjoyable fiction books I've read."
7,3.21,0.9924,2018,07-18,6414100,Taco Mayo,Quinlan,,Texas,South,10,"Near the end of the book, Joe Schwarcz quotes Mark Twain's famous maxim that ""It ain't what you don't know that gets you into trouble. It's what you know for sure that just ain't so."" If (some of) the reviews for this book are any indication, Dr. Joe was right: scientific scrutiny is unlikely to change anyone's mind. People continue to smoke, people continue to eat mostly red meat, etc. Those people who eat red meat and smoke are often willing to admit they are participating in unhealthy behaviour. So much more, then, is it difficult or impossible to convince people through the scientific literature that their preconceived notions are not correct when the topic is not something for which literally billions of people have served as experimental subjects (through their normal activities). That is an observation that is mostly independent of the book's qualities as prose and entertainment, but it does identify the point from which this book starts.In a series of bite-sized chapters (3-5 pages), Schwarcz takes us through some of the topics he's encountered and researched in his role as a science commentator over the last 30 (?) years. As such, I would suggest that the topics are a little skewed to the supplements side - there are many chapters devoted to particular dietary supplements with supposedly miraculous effects (to cure cancer, lose weight, etc.). These claims are usually laughably easy to dismiss because the ""evidence"" of their efficacy is non-existent. The book is much more interesting when he tackles issues of pesticides, teflon, and artificial sweeteners. Generally, the scientific literature shows that the amounts of these items in an average diet are so small as to be non-issues. Sure, they cause cancer - in amounts millions of times as large as humans take in. And these amounts are far less than the naturally occurring carcinogens that we are exposed to automatically because we breath and eat food. This leads to the primary thesis of the book, with which no nutritional expert could argue: eat a good balanced diet that emphasizes vegetables, fruit, and whole grains.This thesis is proven again and again throughout the book, and the primary problem of this book is its repetative nature. In trying to keep each chapter reasonably autonomous, and because the conclusions are virtually the same each time, the author cannot possibly make the book entertaining for long reading times. It's more of a ""pick up, read a bit, put down for a couple days"" kind of book.Other reviewers have objected to the lack of footnotes. This is a valid criticism; I suppose it was a conscious choice on the author's and editor's parts (for ease of readability). Certainly I would have prefered if the studies he cites were more clearly referenced. (Rise and Fall of the Third Reich had thousands of references, so it's insulting to think that the reader would pass on buying the book simply because they are in there, especially as this book's raison d'etre is to bring to the public the objective scientific conclusions on the nutritional questions raised in the book). I would add the criticism that two hot-button nutritional issues are not dealt with. (1) Bisphenol-A, a monomer used in polycarbonate synthesis, has been banned by Health Canada and others, but ruled safe (in the amounts present in polycarbonate drinking and storage vessels) by the FDA. Based on the number of articles I see (in newspapers and even the American Chemical Society's magazine), this chemical is perfectly positioned for the Dr. Joe treatment, and I find it curious that it is omitted. (2) Perhaps because this movement has only gained real traction since the book was written it was not included, but the ""eat local"" mantra is in conflict with the ""eat lots of variety"" mantra espoused by nutritionists and featured prominently in the book. If you live in a breadbasket (e.g. California), you can have a widely varied diet throughout the year. If you live in a northern clime (e.g. northern Minnesota, most of Canada), you will not have access to locally grown fresh fruit and veggies for most of the year. Eating as Dr. Schwarcz suggests would leave you with an enormous carbon footprint due to the transportation and refrigeration costs of moving the food from southern locations.It is also curious that Dr. Joe never mentions the placebo effect. Some remedies are effective because the patient thinks they will be effective. Sure, double-blind studies take this into account (people receiving the placebo and the test compound are both going to benefit from the placebo effect, so any additional effect in the test group will be due to the efficacy of the test compound), but anecdotal ""evidence"" is easy to accumulate by charletons, and these testamonials can certainly be true! If you're one of the lucky ones whose cancer goes into remission at the same time as you started drinking three litres of acai juice a day, you will certainly ""know"" that the acai juice caused the remission. So it's my unfortunate conclusion that Dr. Joe is singing to the choir with this book - those with a scientific/statistical background will be convinced, but we were convinced anyways. Those who are the statistical outliers will still be convinced of their positions, and the charletans will continue to make money off of them."

The story itself was well thought out and put together with good incorporations of the flashback to 1931 and the action occurring in the present. I think right after the beginning when Jacob first joins the circus and they get the elephant is a little slow where there is not really much of a plot that has been introduced yet so it was slightly tedious in some parts in that area. The other thing is that there might have been a couple of unnecessary characters that made the story too much of a task to follow at times with all the names and who is who and such."

The audiobook did an amazing job of casting two narrators and it made it one of the best books I have listened too. You were easily able to tell at what time you were by who was narrating and it made it feel so real.Gruen does an amazing job of researching the life of circus workers during the Depression. At no time did I feel that the details were out of place. You could feel the desperation of the roustabouts when they were continually not paid, resorted to drinking bootleg liquor, ran out of food. Reading this book was like stepping back in time.I loved this book! It is easily very near the top of my favorite books list.

Both sets of my great-grandparents lived well into their 90's. For anyone who had this kind of wonder in their lives, you know what a blessing that was....and for those who didn't.....well my heart aches for your not knowing what you missed. Watching and listening to; in particular, my Grand-dad E. was both heart breaking and fabulous! His mind was sharp and exact till the end...even though sometimes his physical self didn't follow suit the way he thought it should. Even with all of the frustration that came with getting older and losing control of parts of his life, he always had advice to give and stories to tell. I would stay up at the barn with him all through the summer days, helping him work on his projects while he explained to me how to tell when a snake was venomous or showing me how to brush the horses out at the end of the day, because no matter how tired you where...they had worked harder. I am filled with memories of sitting and listening to him telling tales of when he was in his 20's and 30's and what they all did to get by during the depression. He also made sure I knew how wonderful it was to get sit out in the field you'd been working in all day and eat your fill of the melons that were being harvested. Reading this book was like sitting in that barn all of those years ago listening to this man that I love so much, tell me about a world that we can't even imagine while he showed me the right way to do things in the world that I lived in now.Reading this book was like spending those summers with my Grand-dad. Sara Gruen made me feel the train swaying as it ran through the night and let me smell the smell of the animals as they stood in the heat of the day waiting to be tended to. She let me cry over the hardship of the lives that these poor men and women lived then let me feel the excitement of hearing the music start up for the shows. She had my stomach aching for want of a bite to eat...to then have my mouth water when the flag finally went up over the cook tent. Of all of the books that I've ever read, Water for Elephants, ranks high up in the ones that made me forget myself and drift into the world that had been put down in the pages.While pregnant with my oldest son, I helped care for my Grand-dad and as he had been an enthusiastic reader most of his life...when his eye sight began to fail I read to him.

There are better voice-actors out there. I wish the publisher would have branched out and gotten other narrators--at least have a different narrator per book. I think this one man narrated the entire Game of Thrones series. I'll slog through because I like Thrones so much, but it's been partially ruined for me by the reader. Where are female narrators?Oh, yeh. Audible broke up the book weirdly. Finding any Game of Thrones chapter is a challenge ANYWAY, but Audible contributes to the confusion. For example, the chapter I am in is Chapter 34 (Bran 3), p 521 UK Paperback [...]. In this Audible book, it is Part 3, Chapter 11.

I love books written that way.Anyway the story is about a young veterinary student who falls into terrible misfortune and with few options joins a travelling circus, The (unscrupulous) Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth.Time period is in the 1920's or 30's, during The Great Depression. Narrated by an old man, 90 or 93 he says. Who is (unhappily) living out his days at a nursing home. Ah but he wasn't always an old man.The book appears to have been carefully researched and many of the characters and incidents are based on actual people, animals and or occurrences in circus of times past.At times funny, sad, heartbreaking yet hopeful this one will stay with me for a long while.

Tyrion seems to go everywhere and arrive nowhere. Daenerys's thread ends just as she finally does what we've been waiting for her to do for five books.

This book was a soap opera in print. The characters were mostly stereotypical, ergo predictable. I don't think giving the ending away in the prologue was such a great idea, because I spent the next 330+ pages waiting for something (anything!) to happen in that vein. Instead I found myself wading through pages of the author describing events such as tent raising, etc.. The romantic scenes were very campy. During the first several chapters when the book's format became aparent, I thought it was very fascinating to have the elder scenes interspersed with the circus scenes. It turns out that they didn't add much to the story, or even make me want to keep reading. The writing in the elder scenes was amusing, and soon those chapters became my reward for reading the cirucs chapters. The ending was perhaps the most aggravating aspect of this book. Something about Gruen's description of circus life and all its attendant characters makes me think it highly unlikely that a modern-day cirucs manager would embrace a decrepit old man and rescue him from life at the rest home. Maybe it was all those descriptions of redlighting we were given...I'm not sure. All said, I enjoyed Gruen's writing style, but I would have enjoyed it much more telling a story with some substance."

That's the word that comes to mind when I think about Kim Stanley Robinson sitting down one day and saying, ""hmmm, I think I'll write a detailed, scientifically rigorous, realistic book (actually trilogy) about the human colonization of another planet -specifically, Mars. And besides the science and technology of it, I'll basically write a 'how to' guide, listing all the potential problems, in terms of politics, philosophy, economics, sociology, ecology, and human psychology. Finally, I'll explore how developments on Earth affect the Martian colonization effort, and vice versa. And, finally, I'll make all this both intelligent enough to be read by a scientist and understandable (and entertaining) enough for the average reader. No problem! &quot;And somehow, for the most part, Kim Stanley Robinson pulls it off. Sure, the characters can be one-dimensional and even grating and annoying, the plot can get confusing (and melodramatic at times - epic upheaval, rivalries, loves, friendships forming and falling to pieces - yikes, sounds like a bad romance novel!), and the whole book sometimes feels like it's about to come crashing down like the space elevator (Robinson is NOT a great narrative writer, that's for sure!), but still....what a vision, what an ambitious undertaking, what a tremendous amount of research obviously went into this, and what a fascinating subject! This is true SCIENCE fiction, and a credible vision (even a blueprint) for what human colonization of Mars (and the future of Earth) could be like in the not-too-distant future. Personally, after reading (I admit, sometimes it felt like slogging through) this book, I now believe that human colonization of Mars is realistic, not just a dream, and with technology now in existence, under development, or within our g rasp in the coming decades (nanotechnology, biotechnology, materials science, etc.) Finally, after reading ""Red Mars"" I came to believe that is not only FEASIBLE to colonize Mars, but probably (I still have my doubts, especially if we just make the same mistakes we have made in screwing up the Earth) WORTH it as well.My major problems with ""Red Mars"": the characters can be cardboard/one-dimensional, annoying, stereotypical (i.e. Sax - the brilliant, rational, but passionless, at least on the surface, scientist; Ann - the moody, emotional, also brilliant in her own way, ""Red Mars"" purist ; Hiroko - the mysterious Japanese ""Green Mars"" cult figure; John Boone - the politician, etc.; Coyote -- the mysterious revoluationary/anarchist), and even laughable at times; the plot can get very confusing, especially with its cast of thousands and its unfamiliar places and names (more and better maps, plus a top-notch appendix, would have been extremely helpful!); things can get repetitive (how many times can we hear the same basic Red/Green argument, for instance, without getting sick of it?), and the writing style can be dry (LOTS of technobabble), humorless, and verrrry slow, and also so predictable at times you can see things coming 50 pages away.Is this great fiction? Definitely not -- in fact it's pretty bad at times! Is this a great book? Well, I wouldn't go THAT far! Is this a great accomplishment? Well, yes, most definitely! If you're at all interested in space exploration, and specifically Mars, I strongly recommend that you read this book. After reading ""Red Mars,"" I'm ready to sign up for the first mission to Mars - when do we leave?"

I read 'The Old Man and the Sea' many, many years ago ( it was really my inspiration and beginning to what has become a lifelong love of books and reading), and I felt I needed to read more to find out what all the fuss was about. Well, this story may have been gripping in 1935 or 1940 or whenever it was written, but I am struggling to finish it. There is of course the ubiquitous double standard for men and women that was the accepted way of life in its time. I understand all that but its like reading about things that happened on another planet. There's the addressing of each other as 'thee' and 'thou' which I'm guessing has something to do with translating Spanish to English but as the book is in English I have to wonder why this is even addressed. Also, why are all the characters referred to by their first names : 'Pilar', 'Maria', etc., but our hero the protagonist is always identified by both first and last names? It was annoying at first - but I've become used to it at this point I guess. I've suspect that this story is NOT going to have a happy ending but I don't know for sure yet. I don't think Maria is going to get her chance at a lifetime of happiness which would undoubtedly consist of making babies and stew for R.J."

August was cruel, sadistic and had violent mood swings. None of these are symptoms of schizophrenia. He did not hear voices, have complicated delusions, or an inability to keep touch with reality. Unlike most unmedicated schizophenics, August had no trouble thinking rationally or logically, on the contrary, he was in charge of a large section of the circus and exhibited fine organizational skills!The writer could simply have portrayed her character, August, as a jealous, violent man but instead she chose to advance the false stigma that people with schizophrenia are horribly cruel and violent or that they have a ""split"" personality. If only Gruen had researched psychiatry as well as she had the circus.I work with people who suffer from this disease. While, without medication the patients delusions might possibly, rarely, lead them to do something violent, it's usually in relationship to fear associated with a delusion -- thinking a person is really an alien from outerspace, for example. Never the sort of cold-blooded violence August engaged in. August always knew exactly who or what he was hurting.When medicated, people with schizophrenia are actually less likely to commit violent acts than the general population.It's truly a shame when a popular book spreads stigma in this manner, the negative ripple effects go on and on."

5,3.08,0.9994,1995,01-05,2928200,Shari's Restaurant,Redmond,,Western Kentucky,Midwest,8,"Six years in the making; over a thousand pages in length: while A Dance with Dragons has gone on to become an instant super bestseller (as well as the hardcover outselling the eBook edition), sadly the best thing about this book is really that fantastically mesmerizing cover. This mighty tome falls more in line with its less well received and not so well reviewed predecessor, A Feast for Crows, than with the groundbreaking first three books of A Song of Ice and Fire. It seems that time may not be the best thing for George R. R. Martin when it comes to writing his epic series, as he seems to enjoy spending more time describing scenery, and food, and anything gruesome or unpleasant than moving the story along. He goes on tangents, taking trips with new characters that appear to have little bearing on the main plot; or spends literally hundreds of pages with characters readers have come to know so well and love . . . and nothing bloody happens! Martin is becoming what can only really be truthfully described as Jordanian; no he's not immigrating to Jordan, but writing in the style of the man who became the true master of the ""massive mass market,"" Robert Jordan.Warning: here be spoilers.In the North, around the Wall, King Stannis Baratheon seems to spend a lot of time trying to decide what to do with no real power or army to use, while listening to Lady Melisandre, who continues to spout enigmatic prophecies that make little sense; yet readers do get to enjoy a chapter from her viewpoint for the first time. Meanwhile, Jon Snow is elected as the 998th Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, as he must deal with not just enemies beyond the Wall, but also amongst the very men he leads and is in charge of. He works with the wildlings, bringing them south of the wall to bolster his forces in preparation for a possible attack from the Others; it seems to be an interesting act of diplomacy, but goes on for far too many pages, with little action or continuing story taking place.Much of the rest of the book takes place to the far east. Martin has provided a couple of new maps, but nothing so clearly defined and comprehendible as the great continent of Westeros. Tyrion flees to Pentos, drowning himself in wine. He is forced to join with a group traveling to Meereen, along with the apparently not so dead prince Aegon Targaryen. Tyrion - as he always does - manages to get involved in a whole variety of adventures, including the meeting of another dwarf, and a female no less!Daenerys is the character that seems most put through the ringer in this book; much like Cercei was in A Feast for Crows. She is no longer the tough, proud, defiant woman that everyone feared, and not just because she has three growing dragons. Having conquered Meereen, she should be the unstoppable, unquestionable queen that she is, and yet insurrection is afoot and Daenerys cannot seem to decide what to do; perhaps it is because she has become obsessed and besotted with one of her soldiers and seems to be able to think of little else when he is nearby, and yet he is of lower class and cannot possibly be her husband. The black dragon, Drogon, meanwhile is running rampant through the countryside as growing ""teenage"" dragons do, and Daenerys has no idea how to control him.Finally there is Quentyn Martell, Prince of Dorne, whose story comes from nowhere as we follow his trek across the lands to Meereen, where he hopes to woo Daenerys by enslaving one of her dragons. It does not end well for him. Interspersed throughout the lengthy book are other POV chapters from the likes of Bran Stark, Davos Seaworth, Reek (who is in fact the very not dead Theon Greyjoy), Arya Stark, Victarion Greyjoy, as well as some surprise cameos from Jaime and Cercei Lannister. These appearances may not have be so incomprehensible if their storylines were allowed to go somewhere, and yet many of them barely get one chapter, leaving the reader wondering why they were ever added to this book in the first place. What was the point? Especially when many hundreds of pages are spent on other main characters, with very little happening with them, other than plenty of description of what they're wearing, what they're eating, and what the scenery looks like. Pure Jordanian!At a recent signing, George R. R. Martin briefly brought up one of his most tumultuous periods in the six-year writing saga of A Dance with Dragons, saying that in a year or two who would discuss it in greater detail once everyone had read the book, but confessing that he had sacrificed at least a year at what he refers to as his ""Meereenese Knot,"" in trying to decide how events were to transpire and what characters and POVs were to be involved, featuring rewrite after rewrite after rewrite. It seems Martin may have in fact written himself into a deep, dark pit of despair that he hasn't really been able to write himself out of. Perhaps he should've scrapped everything and started again? After sacrificing over a half a decade of his life and the reader's impatient waiting, he couldn't exactly do that. Instead, the result is a book that is too long, has too little going on, and falls behind A Feast for Crows in that it is that much longer with less important story happening.There may be a number of readers under the same delusion suffered by those who professed the excellence and genius of the Star Wars prequels, starting with A Phantom Menace; but over time have come to realize the error of their ways and the true reality of the situation. A Dance with Dragons just simply isn't that good of a book, but does serve to further the story somewhat, and fill in the details with many words and many pages and little action. At the end readers will certainly be left unsatisfied, as they ponder on the possibilities of the penultimate book in the seven-book series (assuming it will stay at this number) with The Winds of Winter, where winter will supposedly have finally arrived. The question remains: if winter is finally here, how long will it be before readers actually get to read about it?Originally written on August 9, 2011 Alex C. Telander.For more reviews, go to [...]"

6,3.4,0.9969,1993,06-24,5520900,Baskin-robbins,N Hollywood,,Virginia,East,6,"Nominally a future-history of Martian colonization, Red Mars covers the initial 100 Martian colonists, the influx of workers as corporations attempt to exploit the planet's resources, and the consequences as conditions worsen. The book is divided into eight parts, each telling the story from the point of view of one of six characters. Each character is interesting and three dimensional. The first, Frank Chalmers, is a stunning example - a machiavellian sociopath who arranges the murder of his best friend. The book suggests early on that the characters are dysfunctional, but most are not, and Robinson describes each personality in a way that's easy to relate to. Most readers will see some of themselves in every character, and will be moved when many disappear from the story as events unfurl.Robinson's prose is easy to read and descriptive. He lovingly describes the Martian landscape, and the events that change the planet. He explains the processes and technologies being used to make the planet more habitable. Mars and its future is viewed through different cultures and ideologies. And Robinson describes political and social systems evolving, growing, and collapsing - the only challenges the colonists seem unable to solve are those that cannot be fixed technologically. The ending is dramatic and, cheesy last line notwithstanding, overwhelming.A word about the politics: Several reviewers have trouble understanding the concept of sympathetic characters not representing the author. Nobody argues that, through Chalmers, Robinson is advocating murder, so why assume that characters portrayed as idealistic hot-heads advocating an enlightened Utopia (not communism) are attempts to convert readers to Marxism? Robinson's prediction of a near future where a handful of democratically unaccountable transnational corporations wield more power than governments is neither unreasonable nor extremist propaganda nor unique; nor is it that people sick of these conditions might reject them for something Utopian, and might make up a sizable proportion of those wanting to leave Earth. Robinson is describing what might happen and why, rather than pushing a particular ideology. It is notable that the consequences of the actions of most of the first 100 are hardly positive: why would an author promote a vision of an enlightened Utopia by having for it such divided, belligerent, builders?If Red Mars has faults, they are that it is fairly humourless, and some of the science (nothing, fortunately, important to the principle of convincing the reader that colonization is possible) is somewhat stretched.There are no ray-guns or bug-eyed aliens: there is much to think about. If you're looking for an airport novel, go read L. Ron Hubbard. If you can watch CNN talking 23 hours a day about scandals effecting minor Democrats, and still grumble ""Darned liberal bias"", you may be too right-wing to cope with fictional characters disagreeing with you; go read some ""Doc"" Smith or something instead. Otherwise the reader needs patience and a willingness to get inside a whole range of radically different characters. Most of the book is interesting, but the climax is especially so.Posing more problems than answers, Red Mars leaves the reader uneasy about humanity's progress, with a mix of optimism about what we can do, and pessimism for what we are likely to do; it portrays characters the reader can feel for, and a planet to fall in love with. What a wonderful book."

It ""stayed with me"" long after I had forgotten most of the details. I read the book as a university freshman, then reread it after it came strongly to mind in summer 1987. I was standing on a steep, green meadow in Schwarzwald, reshuffling the deck of life. Like a Hemingway character, I was traveling around Europe living an adventure.Descriptions of many scenes are memorable. Reading as a twenty year old, dynamiting the bridge and the part where Maria crawls under the blanket with Robert Jordan were the strongest. One still likes those descriptions twenty-five years later, but one then also pays attention to the long description of old dead roses as the essence of the odor of death. And one never forgets the powerful ending. Here's how I remembered the ending before rereading it yesterday: Robert Jordan, mortally wounded, sends the pregnant Maria toward safety with the rest of his escaping band of comrades. Lying on his stomach on the steep meadow, as Franco's fascist troops come up the hillside into sight, he pulls back the bolt and takes a bead on the lead officer on horseback ....Because all dialogues in the book should take place in Spanish, Hemingway wrote partly in the early seventeenth century English of John Donne (readers familiar with the king James Version of the Bible, translated early in the seventeenth century, will easily recognize the language). This has the advantage of giving the reader the sensation of reading 'not-English'.It's still a very powerful book. In the context of history, Hemingway was impregnated with the Teddy Roosevelt brand of heroism."

Along the way he is challenged by the Navy to go on a deadly mission inside of Viet Nam. Fortunately the mission is scrubbed in time as the bad guys get reinforcements because of a leak back home about the mission. Our Navy seal returns to the states to finish his work with the drug dealers, but also to do one more favor for the government before they give him a new identity and put him to work for them. He has to eliminate the guy who leaked the information about the mission.

But, along with the glory of the management post, comes the hellish torture of responsibility for the actions of several captains less capable than Jack.Aubrey and Maturin finally fully join their mental forces in the attempt to understand just what makes each captain in the fleet tick. Each at their own level (Maturin's rather deeper), they form a concept of the other personalities they must work with. And Aubrey ultimately finds that even the best planning can be brought to nought by one committee or another...This book also gives us a gently amusing glimpse of Aubrey's life on land as a married man. As with all the Aubrey/Maturin books, this is by turns amusing and thoughtful, as well as realistic and picturesque."

While the book does a fine job of describing the life of a partisan, its 490 pages only cover a few days' time. So, don't expect a lot of fast-moving action. This novel is basically a character study of the different persons in American volunteer Robert Jordan's hosting partisan band. Therefore, if you enjoy character studies then you will indeed enjoy this book.The plot is that Jordan is sent to blow up a bridge in the Spanish hinterland. He is to contact a local partisan band and secure their assistance in helping him destroy the bridge. Once he arrives at the band's secret refuge internal power struggles immediately begin as Jordan's mission will endanger the survival of all the band's members. In addition, there is the inevitable romantic subplot between Jordan and the mysterious Maria.Utilizing the flashback as a vehicle, Hemingway defines each actor's traumatic personal history, his/her decisions, and his character. Jordan the idealistic young American university professor becomes the daring, charismatic, and ideologically indifferent demolitions expert. Pablo the angry peasant becomes the murderous, avaricious guerilla leader. Pilar the ugly yet happy wife of a diminutive bullfighter is widowed and becomes the overbearing, honorable wife of Pablo. Maria the fragile, innocent virgin becomes the emotionally-scarred, vulnerable lover of Jordan. Anselmo the venerable old peasant becomes the determined, brave guerilla fighter. And so it goes with many of the other book's characters.The book is a good character study and portrait of life as a Spanish partisan, but I found it to be much too slow moving for my taste. This is decent novel, but it's not really a war novel. In my opinion, Farewell to Arms is a much better war novel and is Hemingways's best book."

Overall, I liked the book. I found the depiction of circus and railroad life during the depression very interesting. It appeared that the author did some in depth research. The flashback technique between the circus and the nursing home, however, left me flat. I did not feel that the nursing home chapters were of the same quality as the circus chapters and frankly rushed through them to get back to the ""real"" story. If anyone starts the book, however, keep going as the ending is well done.My disappointment in this book came from the author's handling of important thematic materials. The scene was set for so many important (and universal) statements and the author simply threw them away. So much could have been written about class structure, disability awareness, capitalism, fairness in advertising, care of the elderly, animal rights, etc. and nothing came forth. There was no symbolism or connections to classic themes, and I sure missed the place where the main character was equated with the biblical Jacob. Those efforts would have made the difference between a book that will last and one that won't be remembered in ten years."

That is to say, Martin goes on and on, in excruciating detail, about people and situations that have no apparent bearing on the real story. This book is a long, tedious read.

I can understand the frustration some readers feel about this book, as it does go back in time from the end of the 4th book. In the version I have been reading, the first chapter is a repeat of a chapter in the 4th book. I did groan internally when I started the book and realized we went back in time, but decided to give it a try. I'm glad I did because the chapters in the book helped move the story forward, and were intersesting to read. After reading them, I think they were important to the story's development.

Both sets of my great-grandparents lived well into their 90's. For anyone who had this kind of wonder in their lives, you know what a blessing that was....and for those who didn't.....well my heart aches for your not knowing what you missed. Watching and listening to; in particular, my Grand-dad E. was both heart breaking and fabulous! His mind was sharp and exact till the end...even though sometimes his physical self didn't follow suit the way he thought it should. Even with all of the frustration that came with getting older and losing control of parts of his life, he always had advice to give and stories to tell. I would stay up at the barn with him all through the summer days, helping him work on his projects while he explained to me how to tell when a snake was venomous or showing me how to brush the horses out at the end of the day, because no matter how tired you where...they had worked harder. I am filled with memories of sitting and listening to him telling tales of when he was in his 20's and 30's and what they all did to get by during the depression. He also made sure I knew how wonderful it was to get sit out in the field you'd been working in all day and eat your fill of the melons that were being harvested. Reading this book was like sitting in that barn all of those years ago listening to this man that I love so much, tell me about a world that we can't even imagine while he showed me the right way to do things in the world that I lived in now.Reading this book was like spending those summers with my Grand-dad. Sara Gruen made me feel the train swaying as it ran through the night and let me smell the smell of the animals as they stood in the heat of the day waiting to be tended to. She let me cry over the hardship of the lives that these poor men and women lived then let me feel the excitement of hearing the music start up for the shows. She had my stomach aching for want of a bite to eat...to then have my mouth water when the flag finally went up over the cook tent. Of all of the books that I've ever read, Water for Elephants, ranks high up in the ones that made me forget myself and drift into the world that had been put down in the pages.While pregnant with my oldest son, I helped care for my Grand-dad and as he had been an enthusiastic reader most of his life...when his eye sight began to fail I read to him. I wish I'd had this book to read to him. He would have been as lost to it's wonder as I have been these last two day..Mrs. Gruen....amazing. Simply amazing."

What a HUGE mistake....and I will never trust those particular award juries again. This guy does not have much to say, but says it repeatedly, exhaustively, and ad nauseum. The characters are exclusively two dimensional, all lacking passion and driven by inexplicable logic to actions that make little sense.

You spend most of the book wading through this blah blah blah, and when something finally does happen, it is disappointinly anti-climactic.

However, Sara Gruen did a wonderful job with keeping it at a minimum. I quickly scanned over one or two of the scenes and then realized when I was done reading the story, how the little bit of it added to the story.Well researched and well defined, Gruen takes you by the hand and leads you into the life of an elderly man who, from a nursing home, reflects back on his life in his younger years while he was a part of the circus life. Vivid and captivating, I felt as though I was a part of this exciting journey.There are thousands of reviews on this book, so I'll keep mine brief. Clearly stated, this is one work that will remain in my memory all the days of my life. Fascinating!!"

You don't need a lot of depth or socially redeeming value, just a real good story with a very good narrator/character. This is that kind of book.The main character flees his final vetinary exams in a panic and joins the circus, rather accidentally. There, in the midst of the Depression, he meets an assortment of interesting characters from roustabouts to sideshow attractions to performers to evil owners and animal trainers. Of course, being the vet, there are also the circus animals. He also falls in love.The characters are terrific, especially the narrator, who is introduced as a 93 year old gentleman reflecting on his past in the circus. There are brief snippets of him in the nursing home that touching and humorous. Beyond the characters that her narrator meets, Ms Gruen also captures the flavor of the traveling circuses hanging on by a thread during the Depression and the financial desperation of the times. If one were to seek depth, this book observes the dichotomy between the roustabouts who will work without pay just to have a job and prospects of pay and the owners who eat and live well on the burdensome work or others. But still, it's mostly a very good story.Although this book has been reviewed as a ""romance"", there is much more here besides the romance and more depth to classify it denigradingly as a chic book.The book is well-written and the characters all very good, especially the main character/narrator. He is an everyman and a keen observer of the world and people around him. Highly recommended."

My old copy is held together with rubber bands. I liked everything about it. All the characters were wonderful; the history was accurate; the mystery and intrigue were mysterious and intriguing. The secondary characters were almost better than the main characters. Good wasn't always pretty and Evil was evil with reasons and, sometimes, even strengths. You could hiss the villians and cheer the good guys but you knew that these people lived and you mourned and rejoiced with them. When the hero finally wins his lady's love, it's a timeless moment. Her love is an achievement...not a casual tumble in the normal historical bodice ripper. My only complaint about this book was it was too short and there's never been a sequel.

First is the galloping humor, the sharp satire of almost everything sacred. Second is the historicism, the assurance that within the fiction there is a core of pertinent historical scholarship. Unfortunately, in ""Flashman and the Redskins"" the humor is less than fresh, and the scholarship is dismal. In fact, the only part of the book worth reading is the first section, in New Orleans, where Flash's scoundrely luck holds true. The wagon train journey that delivers Flash to Santa Fe wallows deeper than buffalo droppings in inaccurate geography and ludicrous descriptions of trail events. The fleeting appearances of ""Redskins"" along the trail do not have the accuracy, or the ring of accuracy, of Fraser's writing about Pathans and other peoples of the Raj. I can think of two possible reasons, both irritating: 1) Fraser is just as inaccurate about the Pathans and such, but I don't know enough to catch him at it, or 2) Fraser doesn't suppose that conditions in America require the same level of research that conditions in the British Empire require.In any case, I'm gonna stall on reading any more of the series for a couple of years, or decades. It's getting repetitive. Besides, various commentators on my earlier reviews have assured me that Fraser really did mean much of the nonsense Flashman spouts, that Fraser was as much an insular chauvinist as Paul Goodman, that he sincerely believed the British Empire was largely a boon to the dusky races sunk in their age-old lethargy, that if only the White Man had Borne his Burden long enough the world would now be nigh unto paradise. The implication, my friends, is that enthusiastic readers of the Flashman books are getting their jollies from deriding colored people, demeaning women, and in general escaping the self-censorship of their vilest thoughts which they reluctantly learned in school and from the ineluctable reality of modern life. Sharing a sneer with my neighborhood racist isn't much fun after all."

Since he's college educated in vetranairy science (save for the fact he never took the final exams) he becomes the circus ""animal doctor"". Soon he falls in love with the hot headed circus director's wife- and finds himself at odds with a uncontrollable- but loveable- elephant.The book is interesting, funny, and smart, but it definately wasn't perfect. First, it seems like a part was missing, practically. At the beginning of the book, the dwarf that Jacob rooms with, Walter, basically hates Jacob's guts. Plus, he meets the girl of his dreams, except that they don't really spend that much time together. Then, before I knew it, Walter and Jacob are best friends (and no reason to be) and Jacob and his girl (i forget her name, it's been a few weeks since I read it) are in love (but don't want to admit it because of her husband, August.)If you can get past these few things, the book is pretty good overall.

This is the first book I have read from this author and I found myself interested in the book from the first sentence.The main character (Jacob Jankowski) starts the story as a 90 (or is that 93?) year old man in a nursing home living out his life. He is unhappy and realizes that his kids and the world have forgotten him. He then thinks back to his early adult life when he was in school to become a veterinarian. He takes us back to those years of the Great Depression and the adventures he had while working for a small traveling circus.The book never lets you down and the characters that Jacob Jankowski meets will keep you interested. It is a book that, in my opinion, lays open the human experience. At times, the book takes a romantic and even very sensual tone. At other times, the cruelty of the Great Depression and the desperation of people who worked hoping for some type of income or food will remind you of the harsh life of those times.The book spends some time going back and forth from present day to the days when Jacob Jankowski was part of the circus. The ending surprised me and when I finished the book I was glad that I had the pleasure of reading such a great piece of fiction."

They were remarkably nonplussed: ""Duh Dad, a bear riding a bicycle?"" And so, going back in time 75 years to get the look and feel of circuses was a lot of fun. Dusty, stinky, hard work, low pay, railroads, animals escaping, fat ladies, dwarves, clowns, all of it. But the heart of the book is the story of Jacob, a young veterinarian (who hasn't yet passed the exam), who is pulled out of his orderly life and into the circus world virtually overnight. And suddenly, here he is, in a different world, a young and handsome 23 year old being used and abused by the men and women in this crazy circus sub-world.The story is told by Jacob at age 93 and now living in a rest-home. Going between old Jacob with nurses clucking about trying to get him to behave, and then going back in time telling the circus story, reminds me of the old lady's perspective in the movie, ""The Titanic,"" who is telling the story of young Jack and her life altering romance with him. There's something about the technique that makes it all seem very real, like it's all in the present.Jacob's romance with one of the young, beautiful circus performers is a touching and believable tale. The hucksterisms of his two bosses who run the circus, are also very realistic and an important part of the story. I won't give too much away here, in case you haven't yet read the book, but an elephant named Rosie is also one of the main characters of the book who makes sure things turn out as they're supposed to.A very fun, touching and unique piece of american historical fiction."

The book balances the dynamics of maintaining a circus in tough economic times against a host of vivid and disparate personalities that can both support and challenge the stability of the circus. For example there is Big Al who runs the circus with a nearly ruthless practicality, ""redlighting"" individuals who violate his rules. There is August, second in command, alternately tough and gracious, supportive and cruel. There is Jacob, the hero, who stumbles into the world after fleeing Cornell Vet School and who subsequently falls in love with August's wife. The book alternates between the young Jacob in the circus and the elderly Jacob in a nursing home. Some of the dialogue the characters use during the depression era sounds like it came from the 21st century but other than that there is a gritty, often grotesque and unblinking realism in everything from death to romance."

The writing was very well done as Jacob told his tale of being in the circus all these years later in a nursing home, forgotten and old in body, not in mind.The life of the circus was clearly visible while reading this story as was the life in a nursing home. At first I was more interested to have the chapters go back to the present because the past was so horrible to witness but then his present life wasn't that cozy either.The ending was the best part of the book, for me, as it was most tender.

It doesn't care how you picture, name or define &#34;God&#34; or whether you give him a gender and a personality. It just cuts to the heart of how to live and how to relate to others. If Jesus and the Buddha teamed up to write a book, it might come out like this.When I first read it, I found some passages difficult to grasp.

That is, to get so involved in the storyline, I forget about my immediate environment. Authors can achieve this goal by producing actions that borderlines the plausible. When actions are too plausible, the novel becomes trite. As a consequence, a reader will lose interest. When the actions totally lack plausibility the reader becomes aware of one's immediate environment. Within this scenario, the author forces the reader to assess the logic of the actions and the flow of the storyline is disrupted. Somewhere between plausible and implausible is best for a storyline.Although Gruen is a talented writer with a rare command of the written word, her description of flunking out of Veterinarian school was too implausible. EVEN Cornell professors would give a second chance if a student's parents died prior to comprehensive exams! The implausible wrinkle forced me into reality throughout my reading experience. It wasn't until the chapter 23 (page 314) when I realized that Gruen skillfully left out some critical information. Thus, what seemed too implausible at the beginning became reasonable at the end. We reach borderline plausibility.Yet, the novel doesn't end there. A second storyline that Gruen skillfully weaves throughout the novel emerges into a second borderline plausible event. The novel ends with an unexpected double whammy.WATER FOR ELEPHANTS is a wonderful story. It can best described as quirky with several unanticipated twists and turns."

7,3.17,0.99066,1999,04-22,4404400,,Petaluma,$$,Creighton,South,10,"I could not help but notice that reading Sarah Gruen's Water For Elephants is very much like watching the movie ""Titanic."" First and foremost, each offers big historic pageantry, with a rousing ""you are there"" quality. Each features two parallel narratives from the same protagonist, one in advanced age, one in a defining passage in young adulthood. Both feature a romantic triangle involving a young woman who is a victim of her times stuck in a marriage or engagement to a cruel powerful man and the young man of no means who becomes her soulmate and savior. Both send the young man to a fancy dress dinner in a borrowed tux. Both create insular worlds that are set apart from the rest of the earth, one by an ocean, the other by the train-bound peripatetic exotica of circus life, and within that insular world there is a class structure inspiring social commentary. Both the Titanic creators and Gruen took admirable artistic risks in going to material that nobody else was treating and both did their homework on historical detail.Water For Elephants is about circus life in the early years of the Great Depression. It successfully captures glimpses of the American experience and opens up the closed world of the circus that is at once a very dangerous place and a warm sanctuary. Gruen does not spare the gritty reality of disregard for human and animal life. She succeeds in creating a very delicately balanced community that can slide into disaster if shoved off balance. Thinking on the living conditions she portrays, sometimes you have to ask, why would anyone stick with this mess? For the narrator, Jacob Jankowski, it is love for animals, friends and the aforementioned girl.Water For Elephants is, like the Titanic, a large scale entertainment but when it comes down to it, there is no one line or character that is surprising (except perhaps for the elephant). The book is well crafted but not artistic. It may have been very different in the hands of John Steinbeck or EL Doctorow. That said, Gruen gets points for following through on her inspiration and delivering a book that is very atmospheric and historically interesting, with some social commentary mixed in.This edition comes with a worthwhile interview with Gruen and a book club discussion guide that is more like a junior high English class test."

Hemingway summoned all his superior story-telling powers and forged an unforgettable wartime epic. Complex, layered and populated by memorable characters, FHTBT is a true masterpiece. It is like an Iliad for the 20th-century man. The tragedy, injustice of war, engulfing good and bad human beings alike in its remorseless swirl, is brought to life with astounding attention to detail and humanistic depth. As you may know, the story takes place during the Spanish Civil War, a brutal conflict that not only tore apart the fabric of Spain's society, but also involved armies and volunteers from the great powers and ideologies of the time, most notably the tyrannies of Soviet Communism and German/Italian fascism.There is no facile characterization of heroes and villains on this book. Most of the narrative zooms in on the struggle of a small band of mountain guerrilla fighters who are summoned into near-suicidal action by the arrival of American volunteer Robert Jordan with orders from the Republic. That you know in the great scheme of things their call to sacrifice and their violence is just another futile exercise in a brutal war makes it all the more poignant. And Hemingway adds enough insight into the workings of the greater armies and the machinations of politicians so the reader experiences the bigger picture as well.In the book you find an intimate tale of struggle and courage in time of war, a moving love story, a critical view of the ideologies and idealism of the era, a couple of short-stories on bull-fighting, brutally honest accounts of war atrocities (from both sides) and moments of introspection in questions of love, life, death and hope that are as deep and moving as any. But don't forget about the adventure and suspense: Hemingway was a man of action and this is a book of men and women on a mission. You will be hooked and on the edge of your seat all the way to the (bitter-sweet?) end.The last chapter is the most gripping piece of fiction I ever recall reading. It is unbelievably good... and Hemingway proves one more time he is a master of story endings."

Here he employs it to explain the events of a few days during the Spanish Civil War. The plot is simple: an American fighting for the republic joins a small guerrilla unit in the hills, under orders to blow up a bridge at the beginning of a great assault on the fascists. The American also falls in love with a young Spanish girl, thus allowing Hemingway to explore his favorite combination of themes, love and war.Hemingway is, in my view, one of the most moving and profound writers of all time. In this novel, he aptly captures the emotions and motives of those who risk their lives at war, and along the way, offers some extraordinarily memorable stories of both bravery and brutality.To me, the novel's main weakness is the love story. The protagonist's love interest, as in all of Hemingway's novels, is young (19 years old, in this case), beautiful, naive, and ignorant. She worships Robert Jordan, and obeys his every command much as a puppy. Having no mind of her own, she is wholly contented by serving Jordan in ways such as washing his socks and and drying out his sleeping bag.The only other oddity in the novel is Hemingway's habit of translating Spanish literally. For example, he uses thou and you to differentiate between the Spanish speaker's use of &quot;tu&quot; and &quot;Usted.&quot; He also uses such nonsensical phrases as &quot;I have much hunger&quot; as a translation for the Spanish &quot;tengo mucho hambre,&quot; and &quot;What passes with thee?&quot; for &quot;Qu&eacute; te pasa?&quot;. I found that a bit distracting.On the whole, however, I found the novel remarkable. Hemingway's ability to pare down complex ideas and events into such simple, powerful prose is unsurpassed."

Despite being a native-born Arabic speaker, Gibran wrote The Prophet in English, ensuring that his powerful words lost nothing in translation.The work's 28 short chapters recount the words of a prophet as he leaves his home to depart on a new journey. The words that flow from the prophet's mouth and onto the pages are philosophical and spiritual treatises on all aspects of life. Chapters discuss the range of human experiences and include discussions such as ""On Friendship"", ""On Pain"" and ""On Death."" What unites the 28 chapters is Gibran's thought provoking and probing literary style as Gibran's prophet invokes his listeners to live life to the fullest. The book is not overtly religious but every word and sentence is filled with a spiritual clarity.The book is eminently quotable with every chapter providing a nugget of truth worthy of repeating. Amazingly, Gibran packs his masterpiece into less than 100 pages, making it a very quick and easy read. Readers will find themselves returning to The Prophet again and again to recapture the beauty of Gibran's words.The Prophet, which Gibran himself recognized as his greatest masterpiece, is a timeless literary classic. Its truth has touched generations of readers and will undoubtedly continue to do so."

5,3.56,1.0002,1991,12-09,4114000,Healeo,Seattle,,Montana,West,16,"The fourth in Patrick O'Brian's wonderful seagoing series. O'Brian does not disappoint as Captain Aubrey and Stephen Maturin do battle against the French in the Indian Ocean. Here the plot turns on psychological profiles. Aubrey commands a squadron of ships, and each captain is a different study: Pym steady but unimaginative; Clonfert vainglorious, insecure, and unpredictable; Corbett daring but brutal; and Colonel Keating steady and brave. And there are Aubrey and Maturin, separately and together, musing upon the different elements in each of the captain's characters. As the action progresses, each captain is led into crisis, and each benefits and suffers by his particular choices.In some respects ""The Mauritius Command"", at 348 pages in the Norton edition, may be too short. Clonfert is the captain we come to know best, the others are not as fully drawn because we spend no time aboard their ships. Also, the final assault on Mauritius is reduced to a few throw-away lines on the last page, as though O'Brian turned away from the book, unfinished, and simply chose not to write the last two chapters. The book is a good one, O'Brian's intentions are clear. The captains' stark choices are grounded more in their personalities than the circumstances of the struggle. Their fates are sealed long before they join Aubrey in the Indian Ocean. ""The Mauritius Command"" is a thrilling psychological study."

It will not be the abstaining from an act, but the coming of a state of mind. In this sense the most insignificant writer can serve peace, where the most powerful tribunals can do nothing.&quot;All family members, and military figures in this great novel had to find their own form of peace. Their faith was challenged. As was their fundamental ways of life.I especially enjoy how the arthor combined true history with the fictional family. It was easy to relate to each family member, and to root for their desire for peace.The message that the quote above carries in my heart is also something that I believe we must apply in our daily lives. It's extremely valuable to face problems from a desire for peace, knowing that looking directly at the problems, and what role we play creates love that is passed onto others, naturally."

Then in 1940, he published For Whom the Bell Tolls, which would become another masterpiece, the master at his best, writing about all of the themes that had become central to his life: Courage, duty, love, death, honor and idealism.It is the story of Robert Jordan, an American demolition specialist attached to a band of Spanish guerrillas sent to destroy bridges during the Spanish Civil War. He is a professional, and knows his mission is a bad one, that is unlikely to make any real difference in the fight, but for some reason he feels compelled to complete it anyways.Over three days of hiding out with a band of rebels, he falls in love with a beautiful young Spanish girl named Maria. He also realizes how doomed their mission really is and that he must accept what fate has given him, and do his duty regardless, however bitter it may be. He must press on to destroy the bridges he came to destroy.Jordan proves that life, no matter how long or short, can be deeply heroic and full of purpose when we take the right action. He convinces himself of this through his own self-talk, which Hemingway gives to us throughout the book as a sort of code of ethics, a model to live by:""So if your life trades its seventy years for seventy hours I have that value now and I am lucky enough to know it. And if there is not any such thing as a long time, nor the rest of our lives, nor from now on, but there is only now, why then now is the thing to praise and I am very happy with it... You must make your whole life in the two nights that are given to you; that living as we do now you must concentrate all of that which you should always have into the short time that you can have it... You have it now and that is all your whole life is; now. There is nothing else than now. There is neither yesterday, certainly, nor is there any tomorrow. How old must you be before you know that? There is only now, and if now is only two days, then two days is your life and everything in it will be in proportion. This is how you live a life in two days. And if you stop complaining and asking for what you never will get, you will have a good life. A good life is not measured by any biblical span.""Jordan exhibits exactly the type of ""grace under pressure"" that Hemingway admired and was famous for. He demonstrates that action, not outcome, is what counts, and that, despite everything else, there is great value in doing one's duty against overwhelming odds.In For Whom the Bell Tolls, Hemingway tells this story with his characteristic prose, tragically and poetically, as only he can. It is his greatest work. If you choose to read one Hemingway, make it this one. It will inspire you for many years."

It's a depression era story of a lost soul joining a traveling, American circus. It reads like a memoir of the story's main character, Jacob. The story begins in a modern day setting, where you meet Jacob as an elderly man, living in a retirement home.A circus is setting up just across the street from Jacob's retirement home, and the whole place is buzzing about it. It brings back Jacob's memories of his time traveling around the country with the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth. As a young man, he worked as their veterinarian.Jacob's relationships with the animals in the circus, as well as the crew members and performers are my favorite aspects of this novel. The author reveals that many of the most entertaining stories and plot twists concerning the animals were based on real occurrences. The author really did her homework, and it shows. The story line in endearing and entertaining."

It is by no means a standout book, but neither is it so horrible that I couldn't force myself through it.The best writing in the book, I think, are the sequences with Jacob as an old man. They ring true, and have a poignancy regarding the lives and treatment of the elderly that stirs some guilty discomfort. Leaving aside the over-the-top, sappy, happy Hollywood ending, these sequences are satisfying and believable.The larger narrative, that of Jacob in his twenties, also has an air of authenticity, at least in terms of feeling (to an outsider) like a dingy, dangerous, depression-era circus. It is successful at creating a strong sense of the world. But I never found myself getting wrapped up in the stories of any of the individual characters. In other words, I just didn't get pulled in.Some people probably take offense at the blatant sexuality of a handful of scenes, and at the mistreatment of animals in several more. I am not personally bothered by these, as they are pertinent to the story, but neither do they stir me to care much about the outcome of the story. In the end, it was an easy read with a vivid world, but lacking (for me) much character-driven interest. So I'm on the fence about whether I like it or not. But who says I have to pick a side?"

As historical fiction---evoking the Depression Era and travelling circuses of a time gone by, it is five stars. As romantic fiction, three and half stars. The past is brought back superbly: compelling and detailed. The life seems awful on many levels, yet, at the same time, so exciting and alive that a part of you is jealous of the characters living it---like the sailors of the British Navy in the Aubrey/Maturin series (seeMaster and Commander (Aubrey Maturin Series)).The romantic scenes are less well executed, and the author does not well capture the sexual feelings of a 22-year-old man. That is a small part of the story, though, and is more than outweighed by the other bonus the book offers, the reflections on aging from the protagonist at age 93. These are powerful and thought-provoking. I ""read"" the audible version of the book, and the reader for the ""old"" Jacob alone would have made the book worthwhile.I recommend this strongly."

Well here it is: read ""Water for Elephants.""Seriously, unless you are one of those elitist snobs who would much rather spend 8 hours trying to interpret a single poem by T.S. Elliot, than it is virtually impossible not to like this novel.I'm a huge fan of horror and as many buckets of blood as you can fit on a page, so yeah, the idea of a circus wasn't exactly the most appealing of plots for me, but I must say, after only a measly 20 pages I was hooked.I suppose you can lay that on Gruen's incredibly detailed and real descriptions of what circus life is really like. I may like reading about rending flesh and crimson spouting arterial wounds, but even I couldn't get enough of the Benzini Brother's traveling circus and the rough lifestyle of it's crew.There are many sub-plots and side stories throughout this novel, but Gruen is a true master of tying them all together at the end. Unlike Nicholas Sparks's disastrousThe Notebook, this one is believable, right down to Jacob and Marlena's love interest.So, you can choose how you want to take my brief little review, but either way, look at the ratings. 2,000+ 5-star praises can't all be wrong can they?"

It's 1931 and Jacob Jankowski is preparing to take his final exams in veterinary science when he receives the shock of his life - his parents were killed in a traffic accident. With no home to go to, he travels the rails until he hops onto a circus train.Camel Joe takes Jacob under his wing and ensures the young man gets a job. Jacob soon becomes the vet for the animals, but it's his interactions with August, Uncle Al, and Marlena that challenge his convictions. When Rose the elephant joins the circus, Jacob is put to the test. Will he follow his heart and stand up for his beliefs or walk away?Gruen's writing is easy to read. She's done her research and it shows. I especially liked how she used pictures to frame each chapter. The storyline is interesting. Jacob is coming-of-age and has to make decisions that aren't easy. The story alternates between old Jacob and young Jacob, and while not linear, Gruen pulls on the reader's heartstrings with the challenges old Jacob faces. When a modern circus comes to the assisted living facility, old Jacob feels the tug of circus life, bringing the story full circle.For me, the best part was going on the emotional journey with the characters. They are very real with strengths and weaknesses that touch the reader's emotional core. The supporting cast is just as endearing.The book's plot is original and interesting. The setting is American circus life in 1931 and Gruen does a wonderful job making the reader believe the authenticity of the setting.The novel is mainstream fiction and while I was a bit hesitant to initially read a story about a circus, Gruen quickly sold me on the novel. I couldn't put the book down. ""Water for Elephants"" will resonate with readers long after they've finished it. I highly recommend this book."

Coming of age in a circus might seem cliche yet the insiders view of the social dynamics that existed within a circus really put context around the whole ""running away to join the circus"" thing; although, in this case, it might be more apt to describe this as ""stumbling into the circus"". Regardless, while I felt the end of the circus component of the story was somewhat predictable, it didn't spoil the story for me. A truly remarkable story that I will enjoy again and again."

Without Remorse definitly held up.The things I disliked about the book were things that would make it not a good book. I generally dislike the language a lot of the characters used, especially those in the drug rings. But I realize that is probably true to life and must tolerate it in that snese. It does serve the purpose of making me dislike the drug cartels even more than I already did, if that's possible.I felt fear and apprehension while Kelly/Clark returns to VietNam. I understood why he did the things he felt he had to do, though terribly wrong in principle. I liked most that Kelly/Clark realized he could not change the world, only contribute in some small sense. If he believed he could right all the wrongs in the world, it wouldn't be as compelling to read. But he wants to typify the idea that good people cannot stand aside and let evil occur, else they are supporting that evil. But he does it with a vigilante type justice that should only be taken up in novels.I relly liked how the Ryan family became involved in the story. If foreshadowed and made me think what would Emmett think knowing his son will soon be under the protection of that 'Invisible Man'?Without Remorse is a definite must to those who are Clancy fans.

And then this dock blabs it all to her new boyfriend, then the main character after sleeping with her for several days, only after the doc's report, notices the welt scars on her back!

I know a lot of people are interested in reading this book because of the recent Major Motion Picture starring Rob Pat and Reese Witherspoon.Oh, Well the premise of the story is quite interesting, an almost college graduate who runs away after his parents tragic death (nope this is not a spoiler it's in the back cover) only to join a traveling circus where he goes from a stable boy to the circus vet in a course of (well less than a year), and falls in love with a married showgirl named Marlena who is suffering under her abusive husband August (who is described as being schizophrenia but every psychologist will tell you he's just an aggressive, controlling jerk with anger management problems).So, this book has all the elements possible to make it a good read, Adventure, Romance, Drama, and forbidden love Blah Blah Blah !Adventure, Hardly ! Action (Well apart from the few scenes of hopping in and out of trains there's hardly any to count), Romance & Forbidden love ? (the romance element although seems to sum up a big part of the story even bigger than the circus is so contrived, lacking and unrealistic. The characters hardly hold a conversation to make us believe they belong together, I didn't care if Marlena and Jacob separated for life ! Actually I found myself hoping they would just to spice up the book from its predictable ultimate boring ending and I'm a person who loves happy endings) Circus Life ? Well, Yeah its there all right but the writing doesn't allow it to come to life. I never felt transported to the 193os, I never felt that I was in a circus. The descriptions were unfortunately very flat.The characters are the biggest disappointment in the book. They are two-dimensional at best as well as stereotypical. The Good guys are innocent, nice and bearing all the sufferings of the world on their shoulders and the bad guys are greedy jerks and a$$holes who only care about profit and the $$$ money !Some people were complaining about the Over the top sex scenes, Ahh, O.K ! I'm used to reading romance books heavy on sex scenes and this one doesn't even come close. I don't mind sex in books as long as there is a reason to it and as long as it is beautifully written. In here the characters are just flat out boring that they make sex and murder boring.Obviously none of them is sympathetic even Jacob who just lost his parents, we never get insight into his soul. We never knew for sure why or how was he driven by depression and shock after his parents death to leave all his life behind him and join a circus, we never even know how he recovered from the lost of his parents because he never show any signs of being sad or depressed. Marlena on the other hand, well she is in an abusive relationship so its O.K that she cheats on her husband with Jacob. It would've been rather interesting if her husband was actually a good man but she fell out of love with him and ran away with Jacob leaving the circus. Now that would've been a better conclusion !This book/author does the fatal mistake of telling instead of showing. We are told that this and that happens but we are never shown and therefore never transported. I give it 2 stars for entertainment value and because it was a fairly easy/fast paced book to read. However, other than that maybe I was expecting too much but this book is overhyped and frankly way overrated."

Come on! Get real!-If you are not an expert on space colonization you will have trouble grasping where the protagonists are, are they inside or outside?

But I'm here to tell you that, in the case of Water for Elephants, it is definitely better late than never.Even in Depression-era America, Jacob Jankowski is doing pretty well for himself. He is a Cornell-trained veterinarian who only needs to sit for his final exams to make it official. He thinks he is in love but his lack of experience with the ladies means that he is more likely to be in lust than in love. For him, life is still pretty good.But things change sometimes when one least expects it, and for Jacob change comes in the form of a tragic traffic accident that claims the lives of both his parents. As bad as that is, it gets even worse when he learns that he has also been left destitute because his parents mortgaged everything to pay his Cornell tuition, and Jacob finds that he cannot sit still even long enough to finish his exams. Wanting to get away from it all, he hops the first freight train that comes along, avoids getting thrown back onto the tracks, and soon enough finds himself a member of Benzini Brothers traveling circus.Sara Gruen lets Jacob tell his own story by alternating the first person narrative of ninety-something-year-old Jacob, now living in a nursing home, with the voice of twenty-three-year-old Jacob as he experiences his summer with the Benzini Brothers. And what a story it is because the Benzini Brothers circus is not exactly The Ringling Brothers show and only circus owner, Uncle Al, tries to pretend that it is. Everything about the Benzini Brothers is second rate: the ragged animals in the zoo's menagerie are badly treated and lucky to eat once a day, the roustabouts and other workers are not paid consistently, the freaks are usually fakes or not all that freakish in the first place, and the girly show performer has been known to take paying customers after show hours.Jacob manages to catch on permanently with the show even with his incomplete veterinarian credentials and all goes relatively well until he falls in love with two ladies: Rosie, the elephant who joins the circus after he does, and Marlena, the beautiful young equestrian performer unfortunately married to the sadistic August, a man who beats both Marlena and Rosie.Gruen paints an unforgettable picture of life in a small-time Depression-era circus, an environment filled with filth, underfed animals and humans, cruelty, alcohol abuse, varying degrees of crime, lust, and callousness. Jacob, appalled at what he sees and what he learns about August, Marlena and Uncle Al, fights to maintain his sense of decency in a world he never knew existed, but his love for a married woman and his guilt at not doing more to defend Rosie from the beatings she suffers at the hands of August has him doubting himself.Surprisingly, as intriguing as the young Jacob's story is, the nursing home predicament that the older Jacob finds himself in is an equally touching one. The audio version of ""Water for Elephants"" (10 CDs and 11 hours long) is read by David LeDoux, as the young Jacob Jankowski and John Randolph Jones, who turns in an absolutely brilliant performance as Jacob, the old man. Frankly, both of the worlds created by Gruen are somewhat horrifying and both will linger in my memory for a long time.""Water for Elephants"" is, however, a tiny bit blemished by its unlikely ending even though it is the kind of fairy tale ending that I personally would have wished for Mr. Jankowski. Some things, though, are just too good to be true - or to ring true in a novel even as good as this one."

I loved the characters, I was intrigued by the plot, but halfway through I realized that I was FORCING myself to continue reading because the poor old bastard kept getting so far gone on his cheesy tangents of love, and of the minor backstories of characters found only within the backstories of supporting characters (Pilar's matador's tale that consumed four or five pages) that the story suffered greatly.Hemingway fancied himself a wordsmith I suppose, and therefore managed to crowbar the word ""now"" about fifty times into a single paragraph, often repeating the word up to four times in a row, and the truly funny part is that people regard him as a genius for it.So after experiencing Hemingway I can honestly say that I won't be going back, and I can only envy his success."

It has intrigue, dysfunction, love, and amazing human-like emotions in the circus animals (from Rosie the elephant to Queenie the terrier).The movie was great, but the book had so much more depth and character-development.It seems so incredible that anything like this could happen in ""real life"", even during this period in US history. Tough circus life is described inamazing detail.The lopsided human love triangle adds another dimension to this book and its dysfunction. Would highly recommend this semi-fictional novel."

I would strongly recommend that readers avoid this novel.I skipped the fourth book in the series, ""A Feast For Crows"", because of horrific ""word-of-mouth"" feedback, and should not have invested time reading this novel either.The first book in this series was excellent, and the second one was quite good, but each successive novel is more tedious than the prior one. Needless to say, ""A Dance with Dragons"" is the most boring novel of the series thus far.The author continually drones on and on about inane, nonconsequential matters. He spends inordinate amounts of time describing scenery in the most minute detail, and also subjects the readers to numerous narratives that possess zero entertainment value. For example, readers should not read a single Daenerys narrative (they are the equivalent of ""watching paint dry"").At this point, Mr. Martin is solely writing for the sake of writing. My view is that he plans to extend the serious indefinitely in order to reap as large a monetary windfall as possible. There is a colossal difference in ""entertainment value"" between this book and the first book in the series.I gave this book 2-stars, rather than 1-star, because it is the perfect book to read prior to retiring for the evening. I normally finish a novel every week or two, but spent 3-months reading this novel. The book will undoubtedly put any reader to sleep within 5-20 minutes. This book is perfect for someone who is hoping to fall asleep quickly."

She doesn't pull any punches when writing horror. After that, I didn't hesitate to pick up FURNACE, and I certainly wasn't disappointed.Josh Spiller (love that name) is a trucker. With domestic problems on his mind, he pulls off in Furnace, VA for a bite to eat and falls right into the middle of a supernatural power struggle involving child sacrifice and ancient evil. What he doesn't know at first is that the entire quaint little town is part of the evil secret of Furnace, and that he has been picked to carry out demonic purpose. Josh just wants to get home, but no matter how far he drives, he can't escape that little town. Gray creates a wonderfully horrifying tale; the events take on nightmare qualities as Josh struggles desperately to save his soul and to keep the evil from his family.This is certainly a good read. It could have benefitted from better editing--there were times I had to check to make sure the setting was actually in America. But, overall, I enjoyed this one a great deal and can't wait for Gray's next one to hit the stands."

I was out of the country, though, and didn't get to see the end. Later, I spotted the print version in a used bookstore but decided against buying it because it was too bulky (898 pages) and too dated. I wanted a quicker read, and something more modern. Then a couple of weeks ago it appeared on Amazon Kindle for $3.99 so I decided to give it a try. Wow! From the start I was mesmerized. Herman Wouk is a master storyteller and this narrative of the years building up to World War II (based on seven years of painstaking research) never wavers or slows down.Narrated in two voices, that of a U.S. Navy captain who survived the war and a German general who was sentenced to life for war crimes, the novel provides startlingly accurate glimpses of Hitler, Stalin, Roosevelt and Churchill. It follows the life and times of a career navy man involved in the planning of strategy, as well as the retrospective analysis of a defeated German general. The book accurately captures not only the history of the time but also the day-to-day life in Poland, in Germany, in Russia. We actually feel the panic and desperation of the Jews as they are surrounded in Warsaw, and understand the futility of the allies as they see Hitler's troops move across Europe in an unstoppable juggernaut of conquest, and understand the frustration of the German general staff as Hitler makes catastrophic moves in Russia. Meanwhile in Washington, we sit in on the war plans' meetings with the naval captain and get the inside scoop of why Roosevelt acted as he did and why it took the U.S. so long to get involved.Others have already covered the compelling plot and great characters in this book, so I will not repeat what has been done so well. I will add, however, that this is probably as good a deal as one likely to find on Kindle: a week to ten days of truly enjoyable reading for $3.99. I only regret that I waited this long."

About a third of the way through my doctor prescribed clonazepam and I no longer needed the book. Honestly, I can't see how anyone could get through this book without already suffering from insomnia as badly as I was. It is the most boring book I have ever read and I could only force myself because it was the middle of the night, there was nothing to do, and I had mistakenly bought it.I am a fan of hard science fiction, and that is what this book purports to be. But hard-SF needs to be speculative and push boundaries. This doesn't. An analogy might explain - in the 19th century cantilever bridge building might have been seen as cutting edge technology. Imagine someone writing cantilever bridge fiction. The science aspect of it would be completely uninteresting. It would be a story about the politics and economics of getting the bridge built. Well this book is about that interesting. It's a collection of uninteresting unealistic characters involved in endless contrived office politics trying to get some uninteresting science and engineering done. It just so happens that it's on Mars but most of it is far less interesting than bridge building. I'm not exaggerating. We have to read about how concrete foundations were laid, how bricks were manufactured and have to suffer detailed geological surveys of the areas the characters visit.If your preferred genre is boring books try ""Report on Probability A"" by Aldiss. I used to think it was the most boring book on earth but at least it was short and turned boredom into an art form worth rereading. Read Mars is boredom without purpose. Your time would be better spent actualy reading some real science about Mars.Addendum, Jan 1994Well I did eventually finish this book even tyhough I thought I'd given up. Some things do happen later in the book. The characters remain supremely uninteresting and there are still no original ideas. But there is some entertaining large scale destruction if you like that sort of thing. So I bumped the rating up to 2 stars."

A couple of years ago I found a tattered paperback in a second hand bookstore and enjoyed reading it again. About the same time cable TV screened the mini-series over a week and I was enthralled again.This book, and the sequel War and Remembrance, are Wouk's largest fictional works and give a comprehensive coverage of many of the major events before and during WWII. The Winds of War tells the story of the lead up to WWII through the eyes of Navy Commander Victor ""Pug"" Henry who is appointed Naval Attache in Berlin 6 month's before Hitler's invasion of Poland in September 1939. He travels widely throughout Europe as President Roosevelt's unofficial eyes and ears in Europe, meeting most of the key players during those tumultuous times. During this time Pug begins a platonic but very close and borderline romantic relationship with Pamela Tudsbury, daughter of a famous British radio personality.This book and War and Remembrance are classic novels about WWII. Wouk devoted ""thirteen years of extraordinary research and long, arduous composition"" to these two memorable novels.Since moving to Kindle format I am slowly gathering copies of my favourite books for my Modern Classics Kindle Library. This book certainly gets a place in that library and I am waiting for better pricing before adding War and Remembrance. Last week I added all 6 volumes of Churchill's memoirs of the war to this library when they were a Kindle Daily Deal for $1.99. The world of the Kindle really is a marvellous place.I also enjoyed Wouk's 1990's books, ""The Power"" and ""The Glory"", about the establishment of Israel and the 1967 Six Day War and the 1973 Yom Kippur War. After that I assumed that Wouk had retired but was astounded to find that, at the age of 97, he will publish a new novel in November,The Lawgiver, about the life of Moses. I pre-ordered it immediately."

It can't and won't even come close. The character's alone, (Reese Witherspoon and Robert Pattinson) will redeem the satirical shallowness and cliched style simply with their screen presence.As with many of the comments already noted, this book is just not believable. I can totally comprehend how Rosie, an ginormous creature can pull a stake from the ground, okay... even sneek away for a drink or two or ten. But please, pulling the stake and splitting a skull in the midst of such chaos??? I think a more realistic death for him would have been...death by stampede!But more importantly (at least for me)...

Humans come into the picture the more they interact with Mars but a lot of the book is descriptions of Martian traits: the atmosphere, the rocks, geography etc. As one can imagine not much happens. The action takes time to build up. Gradually this book opens up into a plot line taken up in the superior Green Mars. Mars and it's alien untouched nature is a counterpoint to mankind's messing about. The point of view taken by Robinson of a planet wide perspective is ambitious but he contains it within his writing, though there is alot of this and as I've said it can be tedious. Still he's factual, genuinely interested in his subject, scientific and plausible. Oddly there is a visionary streak in the book, with some of the developments the author foresees for mankind's future but I'll let each reader be the judge of this reality. All in all a reasonably good read with a slow overlong easily read opening section (about half the boo! k). Did he have a trilogy in mind when writing ? I'd be interested to know the truth of this.

The voice remains true and believable throughout the entire narrative and is well developed giving me a clear picture of who Jacob Jankowski is and why I should care. Because this is achieved, I am fully invested in his world and experiences. Like wise, the supporting characters are dynamic and interesting, but even given their deformities, whether physical or psychologically, they never over shadow the main character.The book provokes thoughts on treatment and intelligence of animals, economy, marriage, class, race, healthcare, friendship and family. As well as, it forces us to take a hard look at how our culture deals with the elderly.""Sometimes the monotony of bingo and sing-alongs and ancient dusty people parked in the hallway in wheelchairs makes me long for death. Particularly when I remember that I'm one of the ancient dusty people, filed away like some worthless tchotchke.""If I had to give a 'con' to the book, it would be toward the ending when the author simplifies Jacob's journey with a 'run away with the circus' solution.

Into this world Jacob Jankowski is unwittingly dropped, and the recounting of his evolution from inheritor of his father's veternary practice to circus vet to aged resident of an assisted living facility is almost always convincingly told.

Every now and then the author tosses in a cliched reference to food lines to remind the reader of the historical moment; otherwise, nothing to suggest the landscape (literal and figurative) through which the Benzini Brothers train chugs ever onwards. I emerged from WE with far less of a feel for circuses or society in the 1930s, or for aging and the elderly today, than I should have. WE reads like an entertaining short story stretched to the breaking point. There just isn't enough 'there' there..."

I bought it because I saw that the movie was coming out...and I always like to read a book before the movie. I was NOT disappointed and now am anxiously awaiting the movie release. I loved it how it went back and forth between Jacob's time in the circus and his life at age 94. A wonderful love story...but it was much more than that! I highly recommend!

Listening to this story is tremendous, as it easily allows for the two voices of Jacob Jenkowski to be clearly heard and distinguished from one another. This book is a love story, a history lesson, a peek into different elements of humanity that have way too much realism. There were times I wanted to skip ahead because I didn't want to hear the unpleasantness taking place in the story. But of course I didn't. Because one has to endure some bad to appreciate the good. The love story is much more too, than a man and a woman - it involves the circus animals and how they instinctively know who is good and who is not. The history lesson reminds us of a lifetime ago, which really isn't so very far away - less than one hundred years, and helps us appreciate how far we have come. The peek into a reality far removed from a life I live reminds me not to take any part of my current life for granted. This is a very rich novel and one that will stick with the reader long after the last page is turned."

6,3.06,0.98853,2004,11-22,6697100,Christopher's Restaurant Catering,Dayton,$$,Florida A&M,Midwest,16,"Seven hundred pages of fine print, and another hundred of footnotes (in 2010's revised edition) narrate thousands of years over which people have longed for the right to make their own decisions, live as best they choose among each others' mutual assistance and communal support, and to conduct their livelihoods and relationships as they please, free of coercion, top-down dominance, or imposed government or creed. If leaders are chosen, if organizations are established, then these are entered freely and exited at will.This sums up anarchism's principled versions. It seems from early on, philosophers, priests, bosses, legislators, politicians, and generals all have feared such a movement. Peter Marshall's immense survey shows the results, parading steadily the greatest names in the centuries who've tried to make theory into practice. The Introduction begins with great quotes from some of its exponents, and prefaces in Part I anarchism as it is in theory. While &#34;the river of anarchy&#34; changes with each version, the essence of freedom attracts a few each generation to plunge into what, by the heady rhetoric recurring, appear inviting waters of liberation, personally and socially. For, society for most advocates remains, even if the State withers away. The former is sought freely; the latter isn't chosen. &#34;Society and the State&#34; and &#34;Freedom and Equality&#34; articulate this in Marshall's introduction.In Part II, the forerunners of anarchism, Taoism and Buddhism, surprisingly show how ancient this impulse is. Feared by Plato if somewhat anticipated by the pre-Socratic Greeks, its impulses survived into early and medieval Christianity, among such as dissenters, heretics, guilds, and rebels against Rome--and against Luther, tellingly. By the English Revolution, we see the short rise of Levellers and Diggers, and the brief establishment of Gerard Winstanley's commune--and then his about-face later in life, as he turned away from his earlier rebellious stance. Inconsistency, as Marshall patiently notes, characterizes many who in the French Renaissance and Enlightenment and also, as with Burke in the British Enlightenment, toyed with models for radical change without truly supporting them.By Part III, French, German, British, and American libertarians emerge. Not quite anarchist for the term was not yet in common usage, but such as Tom Paine presage if imperfectly, for many sought the protection of a Jeffersonian State, however limited, along a federalist or decentralized system, the dreams of the later 18th century, as revolution sparked the possibility for change and no more kings. Partial anarchists, as it were, abound among Rousseau, Emerson, Swift, Mill, Morris, or Fourier, et al.In Part IV, we finally reach the heart of the book. Classic anarchist thinkers begin with the passionate example of William Godwin, the lover of order. Next comes the near-Nietzschian Max Stirner, the conscious egoist, who as many would angered Marx. Pierre-Joseph Proudhon's intricate theories reveal the philosopher of poverty. Two Russians pair off: Michael Bakunin as the fanatic of freedom, full of inconsistencies as many theorists seem to be in this century. Peter Kropotkin, the revolutionary evolutionist, tries to tame the theories with a study of geography and science to fit anarchism within a natural determinism, akin to many world-changing paradigms of the nineteenth century. So does, on a smaller scale, the fierce Elise&#769;e Reclus: the geographer of liberty. For all but Reclus in this long part, Marshall offers a grand sweep of their life and thought before entering topics such as their ethical views, political attitudes, thoughts on the State or human nature, to clarify particular ideas in depth.The twentieth century's Errico Malatesta, the electrician of revolution, sparks a new current: the energy of the will, not of nature, as a way to transform human drives towards peaceful (again a contentious point among many, as the fall of the Paris Commune and the rise of WWI split many) goals. Marshall seems to sympathize with those who reject war or violence, as these are coercive means to achieve the end of the end of class antagonism, national boundaries, and capitalist rule.Leo Tolstoy, the count of peace, gets sympathetic treatment, and various American individualists and anti-State Communists such as Lysander Spooner (who finally takes on a question I'd been waiting for ever since I read Locke to ask: who signed us up to the social contract established by the &#34;consent of the governed&#34; centuries ago?), Voltairine de Cleyre, Benjamin Tucker, and Alexander Berkman but they're all skimmed over too hastily, in admittedly a very lengthy book as it is. Sasha B's companion,Emma Goldman as &#34;the most dangerous woman&#34; earns a brisk, lively study, as Marshall scans her ambiguous position between understanding and condoning the use of violence to achieve liberation.German Communists, notably the brave martyr to the cause in the aftermath of 1919's failed Munich soviet, Gustav Landauer, follow suit, and then Mohandas Gandhi, who counters brutality as &#34;the gentle revolutionary&#34;; a strength of Marshall's treatment is that he firmly if gently calls out Gandhi for devolving from leader to guru with a cult of personality, or chides in part V, &#34;Anarchism in action,&#34; those in France, Italy, and Spain who capitulated to compromise, as with the CNT-FAI, and so lost the momentum of the social revolution, during Spain's war against fascism--and Stalinism. Still, then as now, some accommodation with party politics appears inevitable for many radicals, to advance situations amenable to elusive goals of autonomy and mutual aid beyond unions or regions.Russia and the Ukraine, with Makhno's early attempt, similar to Spain's at a sustained anarchist society during war, offer cautionary tales, as do repeated situations in Northern Europe, the United States, and especially Latin America, when attempts at progress were stymied by unions, violence, agitation, and crackdowns. Mexico and Cuba repeat the same story as the USSR and Spain, where anti-statist traditions were lured or pressed into capitulation by crafty cadres led by brutal despots.While these chapters inevitably and rather dully in parts tell some of the same narrative the earlier chapters on leading anarchists had, depending on the nation, glimpses at such movements as French Situationists, British punks, American Wobblies, and German agitators show how the 20c managed in a few nations to survive its heyday 1880-1930 and a few progressives lived long enough to see the 1960s and inspire younger activists. The downside of this in India, where the Sarvodaya movement was co-opted by a very clever politician who used it for his own party advancement, is also telling.After a hasty look at Asia (many regions get a rapid glance, and this tends to be names-and-dates and unions-full-of-initials types of coverage, of uneven interest compared to earlier biographical narrative), Marshall shifts in part VI to modern anarchism, with the New Left and the counterculture. This lively section looks at Situationists, Kabouters, Provos, and Greens along with anarchists themselves, as by the 1960s, a loose collective rather than unions or platforms drives many experiments. One of these, concocted on the New Right as anarcho-capitalism, merits blunt critique.Modern libertarians and anarchists gain briefer mention; Murray Bookchin and his ecology of freedom meets an in-depth challenge as Marshall takes on this former and then future Marxist who bridled at the &#34;lifestyle&#34; rather than &#34;social&#34; anarchists as insufficiently committed. Marshall's passion emerges here and makes this part of the book lively and spirited. Similarly, his reprise as Part VII of the book's contents, as he reviews the big thinkers who established the legacy of anarchism, its ends and means, and the relevance of anarchism, along with an epilogue, shows how difficult it is for the author to let go of this vast topic. He examines the strengths and weaknesses, he tackles the applicability of this ideal to our &#34;post-scarcity&#34; economy after the heady utopian dreams of the 60s have given way to environmental damage, job loss, unfettered capitalism, and a commodity culture.Again, in the last sections there is some repetition, and certain material gets included a third time, for overlap of thinkers, regions, and recent events may be inevitable. A history of a big idea causes the weight of a big book. But anyone who's read shorter works such as Colin Ward's Anarchy: A Very Short Introduction or the newer A Living Spirit of Revolt by Ziga Vodovnik (both reviewed by me in May 2014 here) will welcome Marshall.P.S. This massive work might be read on a Kindle so note-taking can be eased. As the print copy and bulk necessitate a very small font, readers may prefer a dual version. I found the index and notes easier to consult in book fashion, but the highlighting made an e-book appealing. A few typos remained, and the margins of a Kindle version meant that 40% of the text was end-material, but the portability of this meant I could finally finish what I'd been making my way through in print, slowly..."

There weren't any twists really, any shockers, and nothing that wasn't really expected. The ""shocking"" ending was more of just an ""hmm, all right."" It didn't really change anything nor did it affect how I felt towards any of the characters.The story is a good one that did keep me reading and interested. It shifted between the past and present day as the protagonist continued to reminisce about previous years and reflected on his current life. I did not really get connected to any of the characters and I just felt like there was something missing from this book that I just couldn't put my finger on.The characters were interesting, the story was good, and the setting was of course new and refreshing. But it just seemed something was lacking. As I was reading the ""Reader's Questions"" in the back contemporary books are starting to put in, I found that they weren't many powerful themes or internalizations to take away from this book. That doesn't mean the book was bad because it was just a straight-forward story, it just was missing something.All the parts woven together make an all right read, but nothing amazing or enlightening."
5,3.12,0.99848,1993,06-23,4371900,,Carrollton,,George Washington,West,12,"I spent the better part of the time it took me to read this book experiencing two states: confusion and and extreme desire to get through it. Getting through this dense space opera is no easy task, though. I did it, though, and although I cannot understand why, I want to finish this trilogy, if only to find out how the transformation of Mars in these books is completed, or even if it is managed at all.I found Mr. Robinson's style mind-numbing at times. He must have become an expert in both Martian geology and Martian geography, each specially less likely than the last. I applaud the author's knowledge of Mars, but frankly, I found that often I did not care where on Mars the characters were or what it looked like. His penchant of focusing so closely on description of martian geography took something away from the ""gee-whiz"" adventure of it all.I did enjoy the occasional human drama of the story. Who knew that, if a bunch of brilliant scientists were sent on a Mission from Mars, with little or no reason to listen to their handlers back on Earth, their behavior would resemble that of young teenagers? I enjoyed their occasional broodings, their frequent hysterics, and their abilities to wrangle the simplest matters into the realm of high drama. Perhaps all of that is a function of the author's acumen, but it was fun nevertheless.I wondered quite often at the colony's ability to expand so quickly. The technologies presented near the beginning of the story are recongnizable, and probably a few of them we will have a handle on by the time we are able to journey to Mars, but the technology has gotten way out of reason by the end of the book. I don't think giant domes that can cover an entire martian crater will ever by physically possible, one hundred or five hundred years from now. Physics is physics.Overall, this novel was not a waste of time. I know, that's not a glowing endorsement, but it's all I can give."

The novel seamlessly alternates between two periods of Jacob's life, beginning when he was in his early 20s, having lost everything after the death of his parents (the impetus for his joining the circus) and as an elderly man in a nursing home.I was especially moved by the author's clear respect for older people through her portrayal of Jacob and the other residents of the nursing home. The conversations between Rosemary and Jacob were deeply touching and I loved the way Rosemary gently explained to Jacob why the man might have lied about carrying water for elephants at the circus. Oh, and the ending was just beautiful. I was rooting for Jacob all the way!I was also fascinated by some of the historical bits such as redlighting and Jake Leg, a disease some people got (usually poor people) from drinking Jamaican Ginger Extract during the Prohibition Era. And I can't forget Rosie, the amazing elephant and where she spent her final years - This was a book I could not put down! I guess the only"

Let alone enjoyed it to the extreme level which I did. A well respected friend recommended this book to me so I pull it up online and read the synopsis. Well, the synopsis and subject matter regarding circus life in the mid 1900's did not interest me in the least bit. Suffice to say I did not immediately read it. Only after subsequent prompting from my friend did I agree to give it a shot. That turned out to be an EXCELLENT idea. It was clear and concise reading that gave me vivid images of that era and written with short chapters that propelled me along to read just a little more each time since I was skeptical from the start. The story recounted through the eyes of an old man reminiscing his youth was pulled off seamlessly. It was like reading two stories. Now, after reading the book for myself I'm amazed at the few negative reviewer's comments. I'm reminded that some people complain about everything."

6,3.2,0.9906,2005,03-08,6435400,La Madeleine,Houston,,Pacific,West,8,"This book is an excellent achievement by a young British writer. Patrick French has meticulously researched all aspects of the life of this enigmatic 'empire builder'.In the earlier stages of his life Francis Younghusband was desparately trying to gain fame and get his name into the annals of British imperialism. In a way time was running out, for the era of great explorations was coming to an end. Therefore the young officer set his eyes on the last frontier: Central Asia.Very soon Younghusband was caught up in the hike-stake 'Great Game': the competition between Britain and Russia for control over the enormous expanses of inner Asia. Both states considered this region as vital for its strategic interests. The British feared that control of Turkestan and Tibet would bring the Russians too close to the mountain ranges separating India from the rest of Asia. The Russians in turn considered the steppes and deserts of Central Asia as a buffer zone between its Far Eastern territories and British-ruled South Asia.Younghusband's travel experiences through the Himalayas, Karakorum, Hindu Kush and Pamir mountains would turn out to be essential for the formation of his later-day personality and activities. By temperament Younghusband fits into that strange category of the late Victorian soldier-adventurer with a spiritual bend. Just like General Charles 'Chinese' Gordon and T.E. Lawrence (of Arabia), he paired a love for action with unmistakable spiritual inclinations.After his military and administrative career in the British India service had come to an end, Francis Younghusband started a new mission in life. He became involved in a myriad of organizations concerned with inter-religious dialogue and the pursuit of world peace. Although, along the lines, he maintained a vivid interest in all 'things Asian' and was deeply involved with the first Mount Everest Expeditions.French has been extremely thorough in investigating this second career of Francis Younghusband, pursuing all kinds of vague leads and intent on turning over the last stone. Patiently sifting through years of correspondence and personal journals, he pieces together a very detailed picture of Younghusband's later life and relationships with the people around him.French's five year involvement with the life of Francs Younghusband was nothing short of an obsession, with the writer being determined to get into the head of his subject. The result is one of the best and most entertaining biographies I have ever read."

The voice remains true and believable throughout the entire narrative and is well developed giving me a clear picture of who Jacob Jankowski is and why I should care. Because this is achieved, I am fully invested in his world and experiences. Like wise, the supporting characters are dynamic and interesting, but even given their deformities, whether physical or psychologically, they never over shadow the main character.The book provokes thoughts on treatment and intelligence of animals, economy, marriage, class, race, healthcare, friendship and family. As well as, it forces us to take a hard look at how our culture deals with the elderly.""Sometimes the monotony of bingo and sing-alongs and ancient dusty people parked in the hallway in wheelchairs makes me long for death. Particularly when I remember that I'm one of the ancient dusty people, filed away like some worthless tchotchke.""If I had to give a 'con' to the book, it would be toward the ending when the author simplifies Jacob's journey with a 'run away with the circus' solution.

Anyone who ever went to a circus and played the games on the midway are rubes wanting to be thrilled, enchanted and take leave of reality for a day. The illusion lasts about as long as cloud of cotton candy. The inside story delves into the darker aspects of what makes the circus viable especially during the 1930's Depression era. The reader is introduced to a strict caste system from bosses to performers to roustabouts that determines one's position among a long train of characters. The practice of 'redlighting' is particularly powerful, a Darwinian, survival of the fittest practice where the circus bosses have the used up roustabouts tossed from the train as excess baggage. Our hero is Jacob Jankowski that over the course of only 3 1/2 months joins the circus. As a veternarian he does not fit into the caste system.

We haven't discussed the book in my reading group yet, but I think that the book raises a lot of good points for discussion (i.e. &quot;would we have done X this way? Would there be alternatives?&quot;).My biggest complaint with the book was his rambling ad infinitum about the Martian land features. I honestly believe that the book could have been 150 pages shorter, and equally enjoyable to me if he'd have left out most of this. In fact, it appeared to me that characters made often seemingly pointless treks around Mars just so the author would have a reason to describe each area. I think I may have been so put off simply because I have absolutely no interest in geology, but the other people in my reading group felt pretty much the same way. This was my only real complaint with the book, but it was such a complaint that I docked it two stars.Overall, I'm pretty sure I wouldn't have given the book a Nebula award, but barring the complaint above, I found it to be very thought provoking, and I look forward to discussing it with my reading group.

What initially perked my interest, and remains of interest, is the passionate struggle of the Spanish working class to create its own political organization of society, its leadership of the struggle against Spanish Fascism and the romance surrounding the entry of the International Brigades, particularly the American Abraham Lincoln Battalion of the 15th Brigade, into the struggle.Underlying my interests has always been a nagging question of how that struggle could have been won by the working class. The Spanish proletariat certainly was capable of both heroic action and the ability to create organizations that reflected its own class interests i.e. the worker militias and factory committees. Of all modern working class uprisings after the Russian revolution Spain showed the most promise of success. Russian Bolshevik leader Leon Trotsky noted in one of his writings on Spain that the Spanish proletariat at the start of its revolutionary period had a higher political consciousness than the Russian proletariat in 1917.That analysis calls into question the strategies put forth by the parties of the Popular Front, including the Spanish Communist Party- defeat Franco first, and then make the social transformation of society. Ernest Hemingway in his novel For Whom the Bells Toll weighs in on that question here. Whatever value the novel had or has as a narrative of a small slice of the Spanish events one must look elsewhere to discovery the causes of the Republican defeat.Ernest Hemingway most definitively was in love with Spain and always lurking just below the surface was his love affair with death. That combination placed in the context of the Spanish Civil War of 1936-39 makes for an explosive, dramatic tale. The hero is an American, Robert Jordan, aka Ernest Hemingway, of fizzy politics but a desire to help the Spanish people. Additionally Jordan, if expediency demands it, is willing to face danger and death at the command of the Communist-dominated International Brigades (although it is not always clear whether he is a Lincoln Brigade volunteer or a freelancer). Hemingway's critique of the Stalinist domination of the military command and therefore authors of the military strategy that led to defeat at times overwhelms the story. His skewering of Andre Marty, leader of the International Brigades, also has that same effect. In short, Hemingway believed that 'outside forces' meddling in Spanish affairs led to death for Jordan and disaster for the Spanish people. Well, nobody expects nor is it mandatory for a novelist to be politically astute or correct. Here Hemingway joins the crowdThe one subject that Ernest Hemingway seemed consistently to excel at was the telling of war stories. And whatever else might be true of For Whom the Bell Tolls it is preeminently a war story. A classic war romance if you have also seen the movie treatment of the book starring Gary Cooper and Ingrid Bergman. It might be a male thing, it might be a Hemingway thing, or it might be that the nature of war lends itself to dramatic tension that holds a story together. Today, in some literary circles, it is not considered politically correct to laud works by such dead, white males as Hemingway but the flat out truth is that the man could write. If his work stands outside the current canon of American literary efforts then something is wrong with the new canon.To make matters worst the current leftist-oriented literary establishment, grizzled, hard-bitten warriors that they are, has not been the only force that has taken aim at Hemingway's head. At the time of publication in 1940 the Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Battalion, those who actually fought in Spain and the various Communist Parties throughout the world were unhappy with the novel. Why? Hemingway was too harsh on the deficiencies of the Communists, the International Brigades and the Republican forces in general. Above I mentioned that writers were not expected to be politically astute. That is one thing. But to say that Hemingway was essentially sabotaging the exiled Republican efforts to aid the refugees by the thrust of his novel is also politically wrong. The man did materially and militarily aid the Republican side (sponsoring volunteers and ambulances). That accrues to his honor. In short, Hemingway's writings- yes. Hemingway's politics no"

It's a result of a project conducted on April 15, 1989, the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China (ironically, just before the protests of Tiananmen Square). Ninety of the world's leading photojournalists fanned out across country and took photos, leaving a record of a varied country. We see Buddhist monks clad in scarlet, people practicing ballroom dance in public squares, hundreds of bicyclists pedaling to the rain plastic ponchos, a bare-bottomed toddler pedaling a bicycle, Muslim men at prayer, a psychiatric patient, and Deng Xiaoping spending a quiet night at home babysitting his friends.

It not only pitted Spaniard against Spaniard, but became a kind of bloody curtain-raiser for World War II, with Nazi Germany and Mussolini's Italy lining up on the side of Franco's insurgents and the USSR backing the embattled left-leaning Republic. (The Western democracies - who might have prevented Spain from going fascist - followed a pusillanimous ""hands off"" policy which only emboldened the insurgents and their supporters.) Into this vortex came many writers and intellectuals. They were to witness brutality, betrayals, great valour, the corruption of ideals, and the consequences of ruthless Realpolitik.So with all that in mind, here's an interesting question. If you were an author trying to write the great Spanish Civil War novel, would you choose to (1) sequester your handful of characters up in the mountains away from the main action; (2) write 500 pages covering a mere three days during which time nobody has anything to do; and (3) make the central character non-Spanish?500 pages about three days of waiting is the book's central problem. It turns the novel into the opposite of an epic. To have taken a canvas as sweeping as the three years of the Spanish Civil War and shrink it down to such a compass-point was an unfathomable decision on the author's part. From this self-inflicted literary ambush there is no escape for Hemingway: you either need excellent descriptive prose or superb psychological insight to carve a good story from such crooked timber, for, after all, what else is left to describe in such a situation save inner musings and the outer landscape?The prose is the next problem. Much has been made of Hemingway's 'deceptively simple' writing style. However, I found it impossible to read ""For Whom the Bells Tolls"" without forming the impression that that his reputation for putatively well-masked complexity is itself the deception. Consider the following extracts [from the Vintage edition]:A hole in a hillside is described as:""both deep and profound""[p. 444]Characters exchange such dialogue as:'Well, then. Oh, then. Oh, then. Oh.'[p. 166]'Maria.''Yes.''Maria.''Yes.''Maria.''Oh, yes. Please.'[p. 272]'But use thy head. Thou hast much head. Use it.'[p. 444]Which brings us to the Hemingway penchant for meaningless repetition:""In an impossible situation you hang on until night to get away. You try to last out until night to get back in. You are all right, maybe, if you can stick it out until dark and then get back in.""[p. 174]""So a woman like that Pilar practically pushed this girl into your sleeping bag and what happens? Yes, what happens? What happens? You tell me what happens, please. That is just what happens. That is exactly what happens.""[p. 175]Followed by some impressive run-on rants as the author becomes completely carried away describing love scenes (How many women - even in the thirties - were seduced by being repeatedly called 'rabbit'?)My favourite passage is when one of the characters reveals to Joaqu&iacute;n that la Pasionara has a son in Russia. Instead of naming the character, Hemingway chooses to write the following clanking line:""'If we insult them a little?' the man who had spoken to Joaqu&iacute;n about la Pasionara's son in Russia asked.""[p. 324]On and on it goes like this. For three days. In a cave. This book has now gone into the umpteenth printing and neither the spelling nor grammar have been corrected (""... the flakes was dropping diagonally ..."" [p. 185]; ""... and then brining it down ..."" [p. 213]; ""... the felling when the Ingl&eacute;s gave the order ..."" [p. 380]; at one point Andr&eacute; Marty is referred to as ""Mary"" [p. 437]).So it needs to be said openly. Hemingway pundits who make excuses for this sort of thing have a lot of explaining to do: otherwise they are obliged to defend similarly poor writing when they find it outside the world of Nobel laureates."

I know that the book was (and is) a wildly popular bestseller, but I have to confess that the thought that kept nagging at me as I listened was why? I'm not saying this is a bad book. It is somewhat engaging. However, I didn't find any of the characters particularly vivid or humanly multi-dimensional. And as soon as Rosie the elephant was added to the circus, halfway through the book, I had a (correct) feeling as to where the plot line was moving, so no surprise ending. I have no idea whether circus life in the prohibition era was anything like this, so can't comment on the authenticity of the backdrop, but I found it pretty depressing. Altogether, a pretty so-so read."

6,3.06,0.998,2011,09-02,9144700,Little River Hardware Cafe,Mentone,,Villanova,East,9,"I understand most of the reviewers point about how in terms of the storyline this book did not move it along. However, we all knew this years back and this should have not been a surprise to fans of aSoIF. We all knew 'A Feast for Crows' and 'A Dance with Dragons' were actually suppose to be one volume but was split up due to size (but let's be honest it's probably due to $ also). So to go into this book and expect something different is totally insane. It's like opening a can of CocaCola and expecting it to taste like Dr Pepper! To penalize this book's quality/rating because of this is unfair. If 'A Feast for Crows' and 'A Dance with Dragons' came out in back to back years this would not even be an issue.I agree with most fans that GRRM is taking way too long to finish this series, the first book came out in 1996 so it's 16 years and counting as of this review! Perhaps if he didn't get sidetracked with so many side projects he would have finished years earlier. The gaps are so long in between each book that I have to lookup Wikipedia what happened in the last book. GRRM is doing himself and his series a disservice with his slightly faster than snails pace writing because people have lives and as time goes on so do our interest and attention span.Now onto this book's review, it once again showed why GRRM is truly a great story teller and how much time and effort he puts into the complexity of characters and storyline. I won't spoil it for those who haven't read it yet but there's a character who we hate because he betrayed the Starks (in book 2) and yet in this book we root for him to escape his captors. This character supposedly really 'Reeks'. A good writer will make the reader feel engaged and emotionally invested in the story and characters and GRRM does that better, if not the best, than many current authors. This book does move the story along for other characters such as Tyrion (my favorite) and what happened to him since he murdered his father. It just doesnt move the story along in terms of the entire series but hey that's not you were expecting right?"

Good parts: The depiction of human and animal life in a seedy Depression-era circus is fascinating. The implausible adventures of the protagonist Jacob, a veterinary student who joins the circus, Marlena, the married acrobat he loves, the circus animals in Jacob's care, and the oddball, desperate circus folk, keep you in suspense and turning the pages. Gruen risks ridicule with her over-the-top romantic ending, which I won't give away, but there's something endearing about her having taken that risk. Bad parts: The admittedly engaging human characters are too one-dimensionally virtuous or nasty. Gruen, though she capably creates a world in which you can immerse yourself and carries the story along at a good clip, is no literary stylist. I did not care for the bookend device of beginning and ending the story with Jacob looking back on his life from a nursing home. If I were rating this on writing quality, I'd give it two stars. Because the story is so darned much fun and I love to read about animals, I gave it four stars. Highly recommended for long flights, crowded commuter trains and buses, or outside on a hot day."

He is as sharp as a tack and somewhat cantankerous, as many of us will probably be if we live so long. At 93 he resides in a nursing home, not his choice, but probably for the best. Now the circus has come to town and set-up within view of the home causing great excitement.Jacob was a member of the traveling Benzini Brothers Circus during the Great Depression and his memories of those days are still clear. Water for Elephants tells the story of how Jacob lost everything while finishing his final year at Cornell Veterinary School and joined the traveling circus.Gruen tells the story in two parts, going back and forth from the past to the present time in a way that is easy to read and very entertaining. Her extensive research into traveling circuses and elephants makes this a very good readThis is one of those books that once you start reading it, you won't want to put it down.

Quite simply, I found Water for Elephants an exceptional read and one that any reader should not miss. Briefly the novel is during the Depression in the USA and it recalls how a circus struggles to survive. The story is seen from the eyes of Jacob Jankowski, an unqualified vet who jumped on the Benzini Brothers circus train, one evening after the shocking death of his parents.The action in Water for Elephants is just right; more than sufficiently paced to keep the reader glued to the pages. There are flashbacks reverting back to the nursing home of the present-day, where Jacob is finding his aged infirmity unbearable, but somehow this only adds to the depth of the story.Sara Gruen has created a circus world that's believable; one that you feel right in the midst of and this is carried through with her characters. Uncle Al, (the circus boss) and August, (the animal trainer) are characters you'll hate. Whereas Marlena, Kinko the Dwarf, and Camel are character's you'll love. Chief protagonist is Jacob Jankowski and I found myself completely empathising with him. His struggle to fit into circus life, gain acceptance from his peers and deal with the urges of his love interest, make him a hugely engaging character.I highly recommend this book. It's a gripping story and is one of those novels which will both shock and thrill you. The stark poverty of the early nineteen hundreds is interspersed with details of the emotional deprivation the main character, Jacob experiences in a nursing home during his latter years. Yet in both settings a light is shone on acts of kindness which define our humanity and reinforce the fragile dignity of those who are almost overwhelmed by their plights. There is a social history dimension to the story which enhances its value and impact. This is easily one of the better books I've ever read."

5,3.12,0.994,2010,12-20,5114100,Hot Stuff Pizza,Vado,,Washington,East,11,"Hemingway published FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS in 1940, just after the end of the Spanish Civil War. Surely, one of Hem's goals in writing this novel was to capture in fiction the full human and political complexity of this war, which was, for a time, the great international cause. This may explain why this novel, despite its great craftsmanship and virtuosity, reads a little long. Hem, you see, had to get everything in.IMHO, the best feature of this terrific book is its wonderful Spanish characters. These participate in the war, which is a great cause for Robert Jordan, the novel's protagonist. But they participate because of family loyalty, fascist war crimes, or class rage and soldiering is mostly peripheral to their personalities. What the reader remembers is not their support of the Republic but the integrity of Anselmo, the dignity of Fernando, the humor of Agustin, the simple loving sincerity of Maria, the harsh surface of Pilar, and the murderous treachery of Pablo. These are, basically, ordinary Spaniards caught in a gruesome tragedy, not ideologues or idealists who are transformed or energized by the cause.Hem also handles Robert Jordan skillfully. When Jordan first appears, he seems to be concerned only with his duty to the cause, which, on this mission, is to blow up a bridge. But quickly, Jordan meets the loving Maria. Then, through this relationship, Hem explores Jordan's thoughts and feelings on life and death. While Jordan is not an extraordinary man with breakthrough thoughts, he is an extraordinary character who, thanks to Maria, both examines the rationale for risking his life and identifies the beauty of what may be its final few days.There are many great scenes in this novel. Among my favorites are the appearance of the planes and Pilar, at fireside, telling the story of her matador lover. And--surprise!--Hemingway is funny in FWTBT, not in a hilarious Robin Williams style, but with the dexterity of a witty companion. With Hemingway's misogyny, competitiveness, alcoholism, and depression now raised to critical prominence, I was surprised to see that the man could be a good guy.FWTBT is number 74 on the Modern Library's list of 100 Best Novels... a bit low in my estimation."

It is a love story, but also a story about life with a traveling circus and all the rawness and crudeness that goes along with being part of the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth as remembered by Jacob Jankowski. Normally, I'd much rather do my own reading, however David LeDoux and John Randolph Jones did an excellent job; the ninety-something-year-old Jacob was especially enjoyable.

By books 2 and 3, I started reading just one sentence per page in some chapters to get through the endless and excessive descriptions. By books 4 and 5, in many chapters I was reading perhaps one sentence every five or ten pages because the story literally moves that slowly.I really don't know what GRRM hoped to accomplish with the awful books 4 and 5. As countless other reviewers have pointed out, despite their 1,700 pages of text, pretty much nothing happens except that a character or two that might have been developed in some meaningful way was killed off.There is so much that could have been done but wasn't. Sansa and Tyrion could actually have learned something from each other, and their marriage might have developed with a little time. Arya was on a roll for the first three books then hit the tar pits of books 4 and 5. And Jon ... what a waste.My biggest gripe is GRRM's proclivity for doing lengthy character developments, then abruptly killing the character. I found almost as bad his undeviating use of cliffhanger chapter endings. Obviously, it is a pretty standard practice in popular entertainment novels, but he manages to make the trite device excruciatingly painful time after time by waiting five or ten chapters, or even an entire book, to again pick up the story for that character.In short, GRRM has squandered in countless ways what could have been an exciting three or four books. Instead, he supersized it, filled it with bloat, and destroyed nearly all forward momentum with hundreds and hundreds of pages of meaningless writing.So I'm done. I refuse to read any more."

And it has a lot of potential. But when I reflected on the story as a whole, I realized it didn't accomplish anything interesting, significant, intelligently complex. I found it absolutely laughable that it had book club discussion questions at the end. For the life of me, I don't know what there is to dissect, analyze, or discuss about it!I never felt emotionally connected to any of the characters, except for the old man's musings at the beginning on growing old and being ignored by family in the midst of their own busy-ness. Frankly, I was surprised that the love story ended up the way it did because I didn't realize the ""love story"" part of it was actually to be taken seriously. The couple was so flat and void of chemistry.I didn't appreciate that the book started with a future event only to get to that actual part of the story and learn that it was quite different from what the prologue led me to believe. That kind of fake-out should be reserved for 1-hour TV shows, not books. It was sloppy and it set me as the reader on the wrong course for the rest of the book.About 2/3 of the way through the book, I was just pushing through to finish it and say I finished it. Sometimes a book can redeem itself in the end, but this ending was too ridiculous for redemption.I've read some good modern fiction recently, but this doesn't make the list. It's a real shame it's going to get a bump in revenue because of the movie -- and because it's a Robert Pattinson movie at that. (sigh)"

There are few contemporary books that will do this for you in such a poetic way.This is a book containing eternal truths. It was given to me as a high school graduation present many years ago. At the time, I found it beautiful, but I couldn't understand it. That is because I hadn't experienced life.Selections from this book were read at my wedding. The sections on love speak of what it is truly about. Most of us never have an inkling of what true love is since we are caught up in a world of attachment to illusions and delusions. This book will help you to break through them.This is a classic that will stand the mark of time such as the Bible has done. Kahlil Gibran is an old soul who speaks in a language that can be embraced by people of any faith.The book is filled with metaphors and parables. It is almost as if Jesus himself is speaking through the author.

5,2.72,0.9972,1985,07-12,11068000,Dragon Wok and Roll,Reseda,,Kentucky,West,12,"""Is where you're from the place you're leaving or where you have roots?""Jacob Jankowski is a young man, studying to be a vet at Cornell. When both of his parents die in a car accident, Jacob is so torn up, he runs away in the middle of his final exams and joins up on a circus train, the Benzini Brothers' Most Spectacular Show on Earth. His life in the Depression era on a traveling circus are intercut with the present day, 90-something year old Jacob reminiscing about the past and dealing with one of the most difficult obstacles: life.I Liked:With the movie due to appear in theaters soon and the recommendation from a friend, I decided to hunt down an audiobook and listen. And, in short, am I glad.Before I started reading, I thought (based on either the blurb on the back cover and the movie trailer) that the book was a love story dressed up in circus costumes in the vein of James Cameron's ""Titanic"". Poor boy meets wealthy attached (married) girl, both fall in love, blah, blah, blah. Throw in some random animals, circus acts, and there you go.I was pleasantly surprised to see that this wasn't the case. The characters were beautifully drawn and real, from our protagonist and narrator, Jacob, to his bunkmate, Kinko/Walter, to our love interest, Marlena, to our antagonist, Big Al. The story focuses more on the circus life than on the love between Marlena and Jacob. The setting was beautiful and intricate, the ambience was spectacular and grotesque (sometimes at the same time!), and I truly felt transported back into the past. Not to mention, there were many tearjerker moments--real, emotional moments, not those written just to elicit a pornographic emotional response.Jacob was a good narrator. I felt his pain as his parents died, I understood his awe at Rosie, I felt his disgust at August's disgusting behavior. But my favorite character was Marlena, and I can definitely see why Reese Witherspoon was cast as her. She is spunky, fun, mature, and spirited. My heart broke hearing how her family abandoned her just because she married a Jew (she was Catholic), and I hated how August treated her. Walter was also another great character. It was terrible how his mother basically sold him to the circus just because of his dwarfism. And the scene where he almost loses Queenie really brought home how alone and lonely this poor guy was.So many novels these days seem to be window dressing for a love story, but this novel isn't one of them. Sure, a cornerstone of the novel is about Marlena and Jacob, but there is much more going on. A man's journey into coping with death. The horrors of the circus. How hard life was back in the Depression. Escapism. The trials of growing older. The need to belong. The story deftly wove back and forth between younger and older Jacob, and I found myself interested in BOTH sides, not just one or the other.I Didn't Like:In places, the novel is very graphic. I didn't care for when Jacob barged in on someone AHEMing or hearing about the two ladies AHEMing Jacob.I would have liked to have seen a little more of the acts that went on in the circus, though I suppose those would work better in a visual medium.Dialogue/Sexual Situations/Violence:A few f-bombs, amongst milder profanities.Jacob is interested in losing his virginity. While drunk, two women try to perform sexual acts on him, but Jacob vomits on one. Two characters make love; ""self love"" is shown once or twice.The story opens with a character about to be impaled. Camel is crippled because of his drinking. August is abusive to his animals and to others. Workers have been thrown off the train, a practice called ""red lighting"".Overall:This is an impressive book, one that totally bucked all my prejudices and preconceived notions. It was able to do what a lot of books can't: make me care about the characters and take me to another ""world"". I only hope that the movie, when it comes out, can do it justice. Highly recommended.Brought to you by:*C.S. Light*"

5,3.11,0.99815,1989,11-10,4841600,Watercourse Bakery,Denver,,Louisville,Midwest,4,"This volume is the second half of ""Flashman's American Adventure,"" beginning as it does a few minutes after the end of _Flash for Freedom!_ Harry Flashman is stuck in New Orleans and wants badly to get home to England and he thinks at first he can prevail on the bawdy house madam who cottoned to him in the previous book to let him hide out at her establishment and then book him passage. But this is the beginning of 1849, gold has been discovered in California, and Susie is convinced she can make an even greater fortune by transporting her girls and her furniture to the Far West. Flashman ends up marrying her (bigamously, of course) and becomes the titular boss of her wagon train out of Independence, Missouri, bound for Sacramento. Actually, having met mountain men and famous frontier scouts and crossed paths with several sorts of Indians, they only make it as far as Santa Fe, which Susie decides is far enough. And Flashman is on his own again -- and to get the cash to continue his long-term escape, he commits an act that is remarkably callous and brutal even for Flashy. But he doesn't get far, being captured this time by Apaches and getting himself married for the third time. It's a good thing he has such a talent for languages! But he eventually accompanies Kit Carson to Wyoming and thence home.Then we jump to the second half of this story, a quarter-century later. One of the more delightful continuing themes throughout this series is Flashman's peculiar relationship with his wife, Elspeth -- gorgeous, brainless, devoted to her Gallant Sir Harry, and yet as completely unprincipled and lecherous as her husband when it comes to sex. In the early days, he couldn't say anything about it because she controlled the purse-strings. Now, in middle age, they've long since reached an accommodation. Besides, Harry has never actually caught her in flagrante. Anyway, Elspeth's craving for travel is the reason Flashman is back in America in 1876 to begin with, and at first he's outraged to discover that she's probably been off rolling in the hay with the great Lacotah chief (and his old acquaintance) Spotted Tail. But then he thinks, as always, ""if I'm wrong and she's as chaste as the mountain dew, so much the better. If she's not, what's an Indian more or less?"" Because Flashman has been recruited to take part in the U.S. Government's unenthusiastic negotiations with the Plains tribes in the wake of another gold strike, this time in the Black Hills, and Elspeth is along for the ride. And then his lecherous nature leads him to lend his name to a land development scheme in North Dakota -- and that will be his undoing, as Fate and Justice come back to bite him good and hard. The upshot is that Sir Harry is bound hand and foot in a Sioux tipi on the Little Big Horn when Custer and the 7th Cavalry show up.I've never been a Custer fan. As Flashman notes, he was quite a good cavalry brigade commander during the Civil War (when he also didn't have the leeway for independent action) -- but he was a terrible army officer, which is a somewhat different thing. And by the mid-1870s, his political ambitions were driving his self-aggrandizement to a point of such reckless disregard for reality that he had become a positive danger to those in his command. In fact, Flashman makes a number of comparisons between the Sioux campaign and the Crimea, regarding the lack of intelligence (in the military sense), the personal arrogance of those in command, and the sheer stupidity of not knowing when to quit. Plus, Gen. Terry was a nice man with not nearly the bloody-mindedness of Lord Lucan or Colin Campbell. Plus, face it, Custer was an idiot, so there. In any case, Flashman survives the massacre, as you knew he would, but he does so with the timely assistance of the very last person he could have predicted. And that leads to a rather sad ending.This is, I think, one of the best of the entire series (though I wasn't crazy about _Flash for Freedom!_). But that may just be me. I generally have to take the author's word for what the British Raj was like, but the Old Southwest before the Civil War is a time and a place in which I have taken a very close interest for a number of decades, both academically and personally. I've been to most of the places Flashman visits, I've read every one of the books he cites as sources in his footnotes, and I know a good deal about most of the major historical characters he meets, and I have to say Fraser has done a splendid job of it. He genuinely makes the New Mexico desert, especially, come alive. I agree that it's a beautiful and frightening place, depending on the circumstances. A terrific yarn. But I have to say it's a shame that the author died before he got around to writing of Flashman's adventures on both sides of the American Civil War."

But he can also help those of us who have yet to break 90 ... his little book of wisdom contains many gems that, unlike your typical golfing magazine article, won't necessarily have you swinging in front of a mirror. Instead they will crawl inside your head and stay with you. And the sweetest and best among them are quite simple: ""Take dead aim."" ""Don't move your head forward,"" and so on. The game of golf, we all know, is not simple, but it teaches one to be humble -- like Harvey Penick, the legendary golf pro. A new book about another great golf pro, Warren Smith, includes the story of Ben Crenshaw at Augusta a few days after Harvey died. After winning the Masters, Crenshaw broke down, his head in his hands and his elbows on his knees, an image that is burned in the golf history books. Warren and Harvey were great friends when both were club pros in Texas."

That said, I find this book compelling, sophisiticated, thoughtful and erudite. The author seems to know a great deal about science, not just the basic chemistry and physics you expect in SciFi authors, but a truly comprehensive grasp of geology. Yet Red Mars is not really about science: It's about people, politics, development and power. A master of character, Robinson does not lack for the descriptive skills of an almost poetic jouranalist, but keeps the story moving with the dramatic tensions arising between characters that changre and eveolve, even as the great Mars settlement experience grows and evolves. In short, one of the best-written books I've read in years: I'm hard-pressed to name its equal."

It is rare for me to find a book that is so entertaining but this one was. I have never read any of the other books by this author, but she is excellent. The book takes you into the time of the depression and you feel, smell and experience everything that the charachter is feeling. The main charachter is in his nineties now, but we get to travel back in time through him, to this time in U.S. history and experience how a traveling circus worked back then. It is such a richly written story, you will not want to put it down. The desperation of the times, the way people lived, their expectations, their feelings, etc. are all here. I have recommended this book to multiple friends, which I rarely do. You will not be disappointed with this story. There are no low points that drag. It's a green light read from start to finish. There is an authors note at the end, and she explains how she came up with the idea and her research to write this book depicting this time period and the circus era. Although it is fiction, she got the facts first and melded it into this novel. Very good indeed."

I know I am an amateur history buff of WWII, the Vietnam Conflict, and the American Civil War.

7,3.18,0.9988,1989,02-06,2367800,Veggie Heaven,Lyndhurst,,Ball St,Midwest,9,"Many years ago I saw a few episodes of the mini-series based on The Winds of War, and enjoyed them at the time. I was out of the country, though, and didn't get to see the end. Later, I spotted the print version in a used bookstore but decided against buying it because it was too bulky (898 pages) and too dated. I wanted a quicker read, and something more modern. Then a couple of weeks ago it appeared on Amazon Kindle for $3.99 so I decided to give it a try. Wow! From the start I was mesmerized. Herman Wouk is a master storyteller and this narrative of the years building up to World War II (based on seven years of painstaking research) never wavers or slows down.Narrated in two voices, that of a U.S. Navy captain who survived the war and a German general who was sentenced to life for war crimes, the novel provides startlingly accurate glimpses of Hitler, Stalin, Roosevelt and Churchill. It follows the life and times of a career navy man involved in the planning of strategy, as well as the retrospective analysis of a defeated German general. The book accurately captures not only the history of the time but also the day-to-day life in Poland, in Germany, in Russia. We actually feel the panic and desperation of the Jews as they are surrounded in Warsaw, and understand the futility of the allies as they see Hitler's troops move across Europe in an unstoppable juggernaut of conquest, and understand the frustration of the German general staff as Hitler makes catastrophic moves in Russia. Meanwhile in Washington, we sit in on the war plans' meetings with the naval captain and get the inside scoop of why Roosevelt acted as he did and why it took the U.S. so long to get involved.Others have already covered the compelling plot and great characters in this book, so I will not repeat what has been done so well. I will add, however, that this is probably as good a deal as one likely to find on Kindle: a week to ten days of truly enjoyable reading for $3.99. I only regret that I waited this long."

I actually re-read the first four books before reading this one, so it was a big chunk of reading. Yes, lots didn't happen during it; there were slow interludes. But some stuff does and so I was okay with the book until the ending.So as not to give away spoilers - it felt like Martin had no idea what to do next to get his characters moving forward, so he shook the snow globe up or if you prefer knocked over the game table. And he didn't do it cleverly. He just said ""hmmm, no idea where to go so let's just abruptly do a bunch of things to disrupt stuff.""Really wondering about the characters we've come to know and in many cases admire against our will. Will there be a whole new set next book?And by the way - very tired of the way Cersei is being portrayed. She's written as a dumb blond, prey to her emotions, sluttish, power grabbing, whatever. Yet somehow she keeps ending up winning, more or less. I think he should portray her as a lot more clever than he does and stop heaping so much scorn on her.Anyway, I really thought this was going to be the last book when I got it. But guess not. Will I read the next one? probably, assuming I'm not dead by the time it comes out or that I haven't totally forgotten about the series (it took seeing previews of the TV show to remind me of the book series and finally got me to check to see if there was a new one out)."

The book reminded me once again of how much I detest nursing homes. I remember when I volunteered at a nursing home... it was so hard to shake the feeling of depression as soon as you walked in, no matter how many activities you planned. It was a sad place filled with lonely people staring out of the front doors just hoping family or friends would come visit them. Yet as you roamed the halls you could hear the most amazing stories of lives lived so fully when age did not seem to have the slightest grip. As you read Water for Elephants just like with any life there are parts which you might wish had been edited out, yet the story so clearly shines the light on a life lived fully and how society tries to shelve those it believes no longer have something of value to offer...**This book is not recommended for all ages, as it definitely contains adult material**"
5,3.16,1.0032,2013,06-14,5311800,Luna 61,Tivoli,USD 0 - USD 20,Akron,South,12,"What _Red Mars_ attempts is monumental: Robinson examines humankind in work, in love, in politics, spirituality, reasoning, madness, life, and death, and attempts to chart a course for what we can become. The backdrop of Martian colonization is well-researched and intriguing in itself, and so are the science and theory that enables much of the book's social and political change. And -- lest my weighty words decive you -- this book is *fun*. A few sections drag, but there was no question that I had to find out how it would all end.The story's great flaw is that it does take place on Red Mars. Robinson lets loose a hundred brilliant, uninhibited neophiles and gives them the resources of a small nation to toy with. Many times during this book I felt like he was gratifying a high-schooler's wish for a magic wand that would let the dorks, poets, and science-fiction fans run the world. His ideas about changing humanity are still quite valid! I just wish they were realized in a setting more like the one we have to work with today.I also found Robinson's lavish, technical descriptions of Martian geology to be painful. They're well-written and doubtless scientifically interesting, but he just couldn't make me care. As a research psychologist, I also have to express that //my profession and I completley and totally disown Michel Duval//, for reasons that should become clear.Despite this, I give _Red Mars_ my hearty recommendation, and think it should be part of the universal science-fiction canon. This is because it's followed by _Green Mars_ and _Blue Mars_, which improve on _Red_ in every way. The writing improves; the characters feel more like our family; and the environment gets more and more like the mess we non-elite earthlings are faced with in real life. If you're with me in wanting to see the world become kinder, smarter, and less self-destructive, these are some ideas you should have in your head."

While the book does a fine job of describing the life of a partisan, its 490 pages only cover a few days' time. So, don't expect a lot of fast-moving action. This novel is basically a character study of the different persons in American volunteer Robert Jordan's hosting partisan band. Therefore, if you enjoy character studies then you will indeed enjoy this book.The plot is that Jordan is sent to blow up a bridge in the Spanish hinterland. He is to contact a local partisan band and secure their assistance in helping him destroy the bridge. Once he arrives at the band's secret refuge internal power struggles immediately begin as Jordan's mission will endanger the survival of all the band's members. In addition, there is the inevitable romantic subplot between Jordan and the mysterious Maria.Utilizing the flashback as a vehicle, Hemingway defines each actor's traumatic personal history, his/her decisions, and his character. Jordan the idealistic young American university professor becomes the daring, charismatic, and ideologically indifferent demolitions expert. Pablo the angry peasant becomes the murderous, avaricious guerilla leader. Pilar the ugly yet happy wife of a diminutive bullfighter is widowed and becomes the overbearing, honorable wife of Pablo. Maria the fragile, innocent virgin becomes the emotionally-scarred, vulnerable lover of Jordan. Anselmo the venerable old peasant becomes the determined, brave guerilla fighter. And so it goes with many of the other book's characters.The book is a good character study and portrait of life as a Spanish partisan, but I found it to be much too slow moving for my taste. This is decent novel, but it's not really a war novel. In my opinion, Farewell to Arms is a much better war novel and is Hemingways's best book."

The ending was not good. PERIOD. Even if we as the reader were sopposed to interpret it as beleivable; it wasn't. Also, if we were made to make up our own interpreation about the ending it still doesnt sit weil.Also, there is alot of catching up. The female lead character spills her story at the end, but it's too much information without a sense of who she really is. Overall, the book was just ok. If the ending stopped a few pages before the end it would have been better. I also felt that besides the obvious differences; the movie and the book were both a little below average. Usually, the book is either profoundly better or ridiculously worse than the movie.

This Deus ex Machina will not help the plot. In real life, we deal with dead people and the problems the deaths left behind. The first books did that. This book tells us that they weren't really dead -- it was a deception. Blech.2)Martin pulls a Robert Jordan and creates new points of view that extend the plot rather than wrapping up plot threads. We want an ending to the series, even if it makes us sad to see it wrapped up.I also found it confusing to read, because even though I know it takes place concurrent with the previous novel, it was hard to mentally go back to ""before this happened."" I will have to get both converted to text, then rearrange all the chapters of both books chronologically to get a better picture.My request as a reader: Let the dead stay dead. Minimize the points of view. Write the end of the series now, and then write everything that happens between Dance and the end. But make sure the end is written -- if you die, at least we'll have a satisfying ending to a wonderful literary banquet."

But last week, I gave in when it was listed at a phenomenal price. And I have to say, I loved it!It is by far the best thing I have read on my Kindle. Exciting, romantic, adventurous and slightly sorrowful at times. The characters were unforgettable. I adore Jacob at age 21 (and age 93) and he is a wonderful protagonist. This book is about circus life and the tragedy of a young man, but it is a love story as well. It is also filled with creatures great and small. So would I recommend this? Yes... because Water For Elephants is fabulous."

It's odd, but the thing I remember is page after page describing food. The problem is that outside of eating, the characters really don't do anything else. Indeed, it's the only thing they can do while traveling from one spot to another. The problem is that they never seem to reach their destinations. Other than the ending, there's a whole bunch of nothing going on. Quite a disappointment for everyone who waited years for this tome. Even Tyrion can't save this stinker.I was really hopeful that the previous book, A Feast for Crows, was the rare rotten exception to this otherwise fantastic series, but sadly, it wasn't. The series has become way too fragmented and unfocused. Martin has become a victim of his own success, seemingly unable to edit anything from this lengthy volume. I rarely say this, but I think the TV show will be better than the book. So far, HBO has managed to do a superb job in whittling down a lot of Martin's narrative bloat.I think it says everything that I bought this book the day it came out and it wasn't until almost a year later when I forced myself to finish it. Sadly, it became a chore. I'm still a fan and hope Martin can rekindle the series in the next volume, but I'm afraid it might have already jumped the shark."

But I did read it and from the beginning was drawn in by the old man as he begins to tell his story. The story is so deeply sentimental and vivid in descriptives. The characters are unforgettable and this includes the animals. Yes it was painfully sad and I was angered when the abuse was occurring but still I read on. I must say this book made a big impression upon me as far as a story of adventure, travel, history and love all rolled into one. When I had my first book read for my debut novel on Friday, June 13th, 2008 the store manager (who took a chance on an unknown self-published author) predicted that my book, like ""Water for Elephants"", would have the same impact in time. She had said that Sar Gruen at first couldn't get the attention her book deserved but on went life to where WFE ended up being one of the most interesting accounts of US circus story ever told. Although I saw no comparison with WFE and my novel, The Skye in June, I welcome her prediction and await the results. But! Buy WFE and like me, keep it in your library to reread in the years to come."

Blose Md, Inc.",Whittier,,Ohio St,West,10,"The first 100 colonists on Mars were crazy enough to want to leave Earth forever, and smart enough to fool the psychological tests for the Mars mission. Neither they nor the patchwork consortium of world powers who sent them could agree why they were there or what they wanted from Mars. To Phyllis, Mars was a geological treasure-trove for commercial usage. To Ann, Mars was a museum of geology to be preserved as much as possible in its natural state. To Sax, it was a laboratory for bioengineering experimentation; to Arkady, a laboratory for social reform. To Nadia, it was the supreme test of her genius for cold-weather engineering. To John Boone, the group's charismatic figurehead, it was the sum of what everyone else wanted it to be: he just wanted the First 100 to stand united. No one knew what Frank Chalmers wanted -- but whatever it was, John Boone stood in his way.Most fans of Red Mars rave about its scientific realism, but I've never cared one way or another about the technicalities of speculating plausible future technologies. Instead, I recommend this book for its broad epic vision, its believably complex political situation, and its portrayal of strong but flawed characters confronting difficult situations with ingenuity, hope, and courage. I particularly like the way Robinson explores the complex relationship between John Boone, the First Man on Mars, and his fame -- between a human being &amp; the legend that arose in his wake. The book isn't perfect -- some things the author seemed to be setting up don't pay off, and I could have done without having the most obnoxious character incessantly identified as a &quot;Christian&quot; -- but it's an absorbing, memorable adventure."

The Slave Bay faux-exoticism was tolerable when it came in small doses, but a book dominated by it makes for a grueling read. It takes the first half of this book to catch all of the less interesting characters up with the storyline from the previous book. Very little goes on during this time, however. Just angst and indecision - 500 pages worth of it. The second half of the book is about ten times better, and the last quarter has some genuinely exciting moments. It would take a lot more to make up for the slog that is the first half, though. It doesn't help that Martin has become extremely predictable. Setups are dangled before the reader and then dashed to the ground (does anyone fall for the prospect of the good guys winning even a small battle anymore?), characters are wantonly killed and then resurrected so often that all of the deaths in the book lose their impact. Introducing a character and then killing them before they can do anything worthwhile has become tiresome, as well. I'm sure that I'll still pick up the next book when it comes out, but I won't have much in the way of expectations."

Oprah's recommendation really can motivate a lot of women with time on their hands LOL! I won't even bother to read the 5-star reviews because I'll probably agree with all the specifics about what a good book this is. It has colorful, well-fleshed out characters with only a few cardboard stereotypes, great sense of historical and circus detail, and a neat surprise ending.The trouble is, this does not belong up there with some great recent, innovative works, the true 5-stars, like Memoirs of a Geisha or The Kite Runner. One thing they all have in common is introducing us to a foreign or unfamiliar world, in this case the depression-era circus. But those other two books have a depth of soul, and a more comprehensive world-view, than Water for Elephants.I was also disappointed with a big, loose thread in the plot, where Camel was to be reunited with his son and the reader was set for that pivotal event, only to be let down and short-circuited by the surprise ending.You will definitely enjoy this book, and be enlightened to learn more about life during the Depression, but keep it in perspective, let's not give standing ovations for every good show."

I can search by text, chapter, and highlight or take notes which is faster to search.I can understand why modern players and beginners might be frustrated by reading the book, as it isn't presented in a format like a magazine with the ""latest"" swing tips. Harvey is an old-school caddie and instructor, but the concept of golf and swing fundamentals have not really changed.Harvey has some interesting stories and anecdotes, but much of his instruction is solid advice. I found it to differ from a lot of advice offered in books like Golf for Dummies. For instance, McCord recommends trying to putt so the ball ends 18 inches past the cup. Harvey recommends having the ball die at the cup to prevent it from overshooting.Overall: 5/5 stars. A classic golf book that comes highly recommended, even by my PGA instructor."

It's a shame, in fact, that Hemingway's caricature-friendly persona, life and writing style have sometimes obsured his work. Forget the macho image and the stories of drinking and hunting. He is an artist of the first order.For Whom... is a novel about the important things -- life, love, death, fear, the attraction and horror of war. What struck me throughout was how innocent the characters are and how genuinely Hemingway depicts the most difficult subjects, be it war (in this case the Spanish Civil War) or the love between Maria and Robert Jordan.Hemingway is a writer we need in our times. He focuses on the big, important issues without cynicism, and never shies from exposing what is in our hearts and minds. A classic."

This story is told by ninety-something Jacob as he vacillates between the present and the past, reflecting upon an incredible life that was not always easy, but was satisfying.Jacob finds himself in a nursing home, his mind still active and questioning the meaning of his existence. Reminiscing about his life, he searches for meaning in the bland nursing home food and the fellow nursing home occupants, most of whom have surrendered their logical minds. As he remembers his life following the death of his parents when he was in his early twenties, he marvels at how every event led to the life he had.Well-researched and accurate, many incredible facts of circus life are divulged in this story.

After all, the best book I read last year was the Devil in the White City and I figured if someone could make the 1893 world's fair interesting perhaps 1930s circuses would be interesting as well. Even with an open mind I couldn't get into the book. 40 or so pages about a 90 year old man - the remaining 300 he recalls his 3.5 months of his life in a circus when he was 22. first 100 pages were decent but then nothing real interesting after that.

When reading, I felt like I was right with the characters, watching them. Many reviewers also emphasize and appreciate the book's unusual story. The story really does have wonderful historical flavor. Most of the characters participate in a 1930s traveling circus, and reading about this circus-society is entertaining and informative.Now, for all of that, the book's writing was nothing extraordinary. While Sara Gruen tells a unique story, she is not a unique storyteller. Her writing was too common for me, too similar to the writing styles of so many authors who are currently alive.As I was reading, I kept asking myself, ""Have I read anything by this author before?"" The truth was, I had never read anything else by her. But I felt like I had, because her writing style and word choices were nothing new to me.I imagine that, in a couple years, I won't be able to remember reading this book. Perhaps I'll hear someone talk about it, and I'll get a feeling of deja-vu and say, ""Oh yeah. I think I might have read something like that, at some point.""Again, don't get me wrong; this was an engaging book. It was entertaining, and I cared about the characters. It was a good read, and well worth my time. I happily recommend it to people who want to be entertained, and who might like to read about the circus. Just don't expect anything amazing.Oh, and if you don't like violence or scenes with sexual content, you should probably stay away. I don't mind these things - this doesn't affect my rating - but I figured a warning was warranted."

5,3.17,0.9966,2000,02-14,5203200,Chipotle Indianapolis In - Hours Reviews & More,Indianapolis,,LSU,West,4,"Hemingway's story of Robert Jordan, an American college instructor fighting for the Spanish republic, is a beautiful story of desperate love and the death of an ideal.Robert Jordan has been assigned the task of blowing up a bridge behind Fascist lines in support of a Republican offensive. He is sent to a guerrilla camp in the mountains behind the lines, where he meets those who are to help him with this task. He also meets and falls in love with Maria, a young Spanish woman who was brutalized by the fascists, and rescued by the band in a previous raid.Hemingway details the nature of the war in the way that only he can, using his stark prose to depict the decay of the idealism that characterized the beginning of the Spanish Republic. This is particularly evident in the character named Pablo, a once-fervent fighter for the Republic who has lost hope in the cause and just wants to be left alone in the hills. Each character has his own idea of the Republic and why they are fighting, which is as truthful a depiction of the Republican cause as could be hoped for.There were three parts of this book which really stood out for me. The first was Pilar's account of the execution of the fascists in her village. Pablo's ruthlessness, along with the growing terror of the people who go from reluctant participants to bloodthirsty mob, is terrifying in its escalation and horrible finish. Second is the final stand of El Sordo, who accepts his fate, but draws a little pleasure and satisfaction in his efforts. Third is the final battle in Chapter forty-three. Hemingway doesn't overdramatize things, he realizes that things are dramatic enough, and the straight-forward presentation of the battle as things go well and then get worse carries much more impact as a result. The stark, straight-forward writing makes these events come to life as tragic circumstances not only for the dead, but for those who survive as well.I would suggest that any reader do a little research into the Spanish Civil War before reading this book, as a little knowledge of the circumstances and people of the war (like Marty and La Pasionaria) will enrich the story immensely.This book is very compelling reading, as Robert Jordan struggles with love and duty, while both fearing and accepting his dangerous assignment. In the abstract, this book is about the death of the ideal in Spain, the corruption and dissent which led to the demise of the Republic. Hemingway conveys these ideas in a way that only Hemingway can, weaving a fabric of sadness and beauty amid hopeless circumstances."

It's a depression era story of a lost soul joining a traveling, American circus. It reads like a memoir of the story's main character, Jacob. The story begins in a modern day setting, where you meet Jacob as an elderly man, living in a retirement home.A circus is setting up just across the street from Jacob's retirement home, and the whole place is buzzing about it. It brings back Jacob's memories of his time traveling around the country with the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth. As a young man, he worked as their veterinarian.Jacob's relationships with the animals in the circus, as well as the crew members and performers are my favorite aspects of this novel. The author reveals that many of the most entertaining stories and plot twists concerning the animals were based on real occurrences. The author really did her homework, and it shows.

Each chapter in the novel is told from the distinct point of view of one of several major characters. Oddly, Robinson's technique fails to reveal anything really interesting about any of these people. When American space hero, John Boone, is murdered in the first chapter, I expected to eventually find out why. Is that alot to hope for? Other events ensue, Mars changes, more major characters die... to me, at least, these characters never seemed all that alive in the first place...While ""Red Mars"" is certainly vast in scope and largely interesting from a scientific standpoint, the overall story suffers from underdeveloped characters, an overemphasis on Martian landscape, and no cohesive plot. And maybe that's Robinson's plan - the major character in the novel is Mars itself, not the folks who live there..."

He doesn't remember how old he is or even the people that take turns coming to visit him. But what he does remember more than makes up for his current state of boredom. The beginning reminded me of Stephen King's ""The Green Mile"". The author obviously had to do a great deal of research into circus life during the depression in order to write this book. What she found does not make a pleasant story. Being an animal lover, the cruelty displayed toward the animals, especially Rosie the elephant, really disturbed me. I still have a hard time believing that Jacob, who had nearly received his degree as a veterinarian and loved Rosie, would not have done more to prevent it. The cruelty displayed towards the employees was just as bad. Railroad goons would actually push workers off moving trains in the middle of the night rather than pay them. I thought the affair between Jacob and Marlena was not as torrid as it should have been. Rosie was my favorite character - she was described in human terms which made the cruelty more difficult to endure. In the end, both the peon workers and Rosie got even. But that was not even the ending that made this book such a great read. I was so excited when I read the ending, I had to tell someone about it! It was the best ending ever!!"

I was skeptical at best when starting. The story is mildly interesting, entertaining,and entirely predictable. The characters were shallow, not well developed, but the story moves along quickly enough so this is not a big distraction.

So, I was quite surprised when I read how the book begins - with the murder of one of the main characters. When I further realized that August does not own the Benzini Brothers, I began to see the movie as its own story separate from the book.Jacob is by far the most interesting character of the book, especially since he tells the story as an old man in a nursing home - and has the wisdom and experience to go with his age. His emotions are infectious and I longed to sit down with him and listen to all of his stories in person way before I finished the book.August is the kind of villain that is confusing in his evil deeds - he has schizophrenia - which makes it somewhat unfair to dislike him so much. His irrational behavior has been exploited for the almighty dollar by Uncle Al - but the real villain tends to fade into the background.Marlena is beautiful to the point of angelic, very little of what she does can be considered wrong in any way, as she is a victim struggling for freedom for most of the book. She approaches August's mood swings with the same caution due a wild animal, and remains faithful to him despite her personal feelings, and does not leave until he first betrays her. Considering how women today will leave their husbands for any reason, I admire her strong morals.The background is set during the Great Depression, which made for many intense situations as the circus struggled to profit, as well as the survival of the cast of characters. Though I studied this period in American history, the direct experience gave me a clearer idea of the desperation of people alive during this time - how easily morals could be put on hold for the sake of another mouthful of food or another coin in the pocket. So many men of the circus would work without pay for the promise of another meal and unending hope that life could still improve.Rosie, the elephant, is also one of the most fascinating characters in the book. She proved to be only one example of how animals were exploited to the point of cruelty for profit. I could not help wondering where the animal activists were.Needless to say, this book sparked many conversations and inspired many moments of personal contemplation for me. I loved this book, and I highly recommend it."

I've never been attracted to all that goes on under the ""big top;"" and, if I didn't want to attend a circus, then why would I want to read about one? The book had the added downfall of an elephant as a main character and while I love animals, I generally don't like to read about them. I thought this book had nothing to offer me . . . and I was very wrong.Reliving his young years right along with 90 year old Jacob Jankowski was a beautiful journey. I normally don't care for the sentimentality inherent in an old narrator looking back on his young days, but I found Water for Elephants didn't use cheap tricks to manipulate the reader's feelings. Instead it had a slow build and satisfying finish - marks of a novel well written. As the old man (Jacob) tells his story, I began to feel all the emotions that he did. By the end, I was fully invested.Gruen brings to life - the Depression era geeks and freaks of the circus with generous but not overdone descriptions. I became so engrossed in that world that it was jarring to come back to reality when I closed the book. The love triangle between man, woman and beast was a beautiful thing and the ending for me came far too soon.I highly recommend Water for Elephants for 16+ and for anyone who enjoys a beautiful love story and being transported to a different day and age."

One reason may be the fact that it's set in America, but I suspect that more pertinent to my liking the novel is the resonance between its two halves. In the first, Flashman joins a party journeying westward in 1849. In the second, he is present at the 1876 Battle of the Little Bighorn, where he meets his past once more. As always this this series, the story-telling is gripping, the prose transparent and flowing, and the historical research impeccable -- the pieces once more fit together with inevitable, easy coincidence. Fraser certainly knew how to relate a tale, and this is one of the best he ever constructed."

Speaking of those two books, you definitely need to get them as this book isn't able to stand on it's own without the follow ups. I would like to say that there were quite alot of good ideas in this book. The whole terraforming of Mars is the focal point, but also the ideas of revolution aren't far fetched. After all, the same thing happened with colonies over here due to differing ideologies and the length of time it took to cross the Atlantic.There are two main drawbacks to this book that are pretty big. First off is the pace. It can be agonizingly slow almost throughout the entire book. There was only one or two parts (the book isn't divided in to chapters per se) were I wasn't struggling to stay awake. If you need something to help you get to sleep at night, read a section or two of this book. It'll do the trick. As some other reviewers have noted, a good 100 to 200 pages could have been edited out of this book and that would have helped immensely. Robinson will describe a scene in 50 pages that could easily be half that or less.My other qualm with this novel is Robinson's grasp on medical ideas. I fully believe that human life spans will continue to lengthen, even in my own lifetime. However, I don't think a miracle cure to automatically fix all of your body's problems will ever exist. That's just too far fetched for me. Furthermore, do you honestly think some scientist out on Mars with limited resources would design said drug? I wanted this book to be good, I really did. I'd have to say it's worth a read once, but it's not a page turner by any stretch of the imagination. Most people probably won't have the patience to persevere through it, honestly."

It doesn't matter as long as I'm fulfilled in some way. I came to this book after I couldn't get past page 90 of one of the most boring books I have ever attempted to read by a contemporary highly regarded female author whose last name starts with P. Maybe anything would have been interesting after that. I found this book to be very entertaining and I even learned something. I have never been to a circus or much cared about going to one. Still, I was intrigued by the setting, the characters, and the story.Reading bestsellers can be a c*ap shoot. I can't imagine what made ""The Lovely Bones"" or ""The Memory Keeper's Daughter"" bestsellers or why they were even published. But books like this one and ""The Kite Runner"" deserve their bestselling positions. Then, there are other books like ""The Memory of Running"" that deserve more attention than they get. I guess what you like depends on your perspective. I ran into a woman the other day who enjoyed ""The Lovely Bones"", but she said it's because her daughter died recently and she liked to think her daughter was in a heaven like that one."

It portrays both courage and cowardice, in the beautifully descriptive words that Hemingway was known for. His main character Robert Jordan is an American college instructor who leaves his job to take part in the Spanish Revolution, with a strong conviction in his heart and truly believing that he can make a difference. The story encompasses a time frame of slightly less than three days, during which he plots to blow a strategic bridge at precisely the right time. In those three days he falls in love with a young Spanish girl in the encampment where he is awaiting that moment and is involved in a character conflict with one of the guerrilla fighters by the name of Pablo.This is a well paced story and never boring, with action suspense and romance, all coming together in a setting where you can feel the cold and smell the forest in the way that only Hemingway can describe it. A splendid and beautifully told story that I would recommend to anyone of any age or gender. For that reason I would place ""For Whom the Bell Tolls"" at the top of the heap among all of his works.In my opinion this great story is the pinnacle of Hemingway's talent.

I wanted to love it, I really did, but something just fell flat. The story was good, although I found the flashing back and forth distracting, and Sara Gruen obviously did copious amounts of research, but I just couldn't get excited about it.The character of Marlena could have been a really interesting and multi-layered person, but instead she is really only presented as a delicate flower who loves animals, married a psychopath, and sometimes displays teenage acts of defiance. Why did Jacob love her so much? There must have been more to her than that, but the reader is never let in on that secret. It's even more odd because the author is a woman. They had strong female personalities in the 1930s, I'm sure of it.As for Jacob, I thought that he displayed a lot of the conflict and inner questioning that you like to see in a lead character and his development as he gets to know the people that work for the circus was enjoyable. His relationship with the animals was obviously meant to heal him after the death of his parents, but again, I felt like that connection was rushed and then brushed aside. His relationship with Rosie, the gentle and abused Polish speaking (well, Polish understanding) elephant, was an excellent metaphor for his own gentle nature and his inability to stand up for himself and break free. Of course, in the end, everyone is free thanks to Rosie and we get the happy ending.I did not hate the book at all, but I wanted more from it. I think if the author had been allowed to write about 100 pages more, it could have been a great novel instead of just ok. The descriptions of the 1930s era circus and the care she took in researching every detail made the book very interesting. It's certainly worth a read."

6,3.22,0.99422,1986,04-23,21257400,Grandy's (now Closed),Gainesville,,Temple,Midwest,9,"This is not the best-written book you'll ever read, it's sentimental and morally simplistic, but it's very entertaining. Good parts: The depiction of human and animal life in a seedy Depression-era circus is fascinating. The implausible adventures of the protagonist Jacob, a veterinary student who joins the circus, Marlena, the married acrobat he loves, the circus animals in Jacob's care, and the oddball, desperate circus folk, keep you in suspense and turning the pages. Gruen risks ridicule with her over-the-top romantic ending, which I won't give away, but there's something endearing about her having taken that risk. Bad parts: The admittedly engaging human characters are too one-dimensionally virtuous or nasty. Gruen, though she capably creates a world in which you can immerse yourself and carries the story along at a good clip, is no literary stylist. I did not care for the bookend device of beginning and ending the story with Jacob looking back on his life from a nursing home. If I were rating this on writing quality, I'd give it two stars. Because the story is so darned much fun and I love to read about animals, I gave it four stars. Highly recommended for long flights, crowded commuter trains and buses, or outside on a hot day."

6,2.89,0.99624,1988,03-29,4699200,Life Alive,Cambridge,USD 25.00-40.00,Auburn,Southeast,8,"This book intrigued me because it is not something I'd normally be interested in reading. I was expecting to be ""moved""--as so many reviewers had indicated. Instead, I was only ""moved"" to flip the pages as quickly as possible to at least come to the surprise ending that was indicated in some reviews.The premise, the whole idea of a story set in a circus backdrop during the Depression, was fantastic. The story itself, in my opinion, failed. It failed for several reasons. The characters appeared to be no more than pawns for moving the story forward--they never made it beyond the cardboard cliche stage. Even Jacob, whose latter years were more endearing to read, was always seen from afar. We never really got in his head at all. He was totally unbelievable. Kid drops out of vet school and joins the circus and acts like a thirteen year old with thirteen year old dialogue.Which brings me to the dialogue in this book. Horrible! I caught myself laughing out loud, in disbelief at the cheezy sentences. And at one point I thought if I read ""uh"" or ""um"" one more time I was going to scream and toss the book in the trash.All that aside, if it was meant to be just a gaudy quick genre-type read, then it wasn't marketed that way. No one ever rose above the surface level, and I simply didn't buy it--the narrator, the girl, the speech during that era.The ending, well, it was okay. It meshed with the rest of the book.And Jacob, he seemed terribly stupid and sophomoric to be a lifetime vet who'd attended Cornell, etc. He was also grouchy and not likable, except when he finally got real about himself growing old. In fact, I came across this passage in ch. 16, ""...my brain is like a universe whose gases get thinner and thinner at the edges..."" I thought YES!! This is what the story is really about: a man who once had keen senses and awareness, and traveled with a circus of all things, has come to the end of the ""show"" and he is facing it and fearing it simultaneously. That was the story Gruen could've warmed my heart with instead of the basic, shallow, ridiculous story in Water for Elephants."

While Tolkien's work will be cherished by readers for years to come, this series has little chance of being a book of all time. It has nothing of the epic nature of the LOTR--except its length. A better comparison of this work would be with the ""Wheel of Time"" series. Neither brings the story to any resolution at any point. This, to this reader, is the most frustrating element of this series in an often frustrating read.Martin stated he would finish the series at book 4; book 4 stretched on in to book 5. Book 5, however, is not a conclusion. The story just stops. It doesn't take a prophet to see that more books will be coming from Martin in this series. I will make a personal prophetic utterance at this point: Though I will read several hundreds of books before I leave this mortal coil, another book in the Song of Ice and Fire series will not be one of them."

The main stages here are the Wall and Slavers Bay with a secondary stage of Dorne, the Iron Isles and Kings Landing. Briefly mentioned are the Riverlands and Winterfell.There are as usual unexpected deaths at the end, Tyrion's interesting adventures and the sudden return of almost forgotten characters. I wasn't interested in Arya's adventures nor Bran's in this installment. Both of them seem to be no longer a part of the main narrative and are just added in for completeness and to fill up pages. Of course this is only going off of what we have so far. The main thing to remember about all this is that anyone can die and the only constant is the rat race for the Iron Throne.It is definitely true that there are just too many throw away characters in this one it can be hard to care much about them or their plotlines. The Wildlings/Crows and all the many characters of Slavers Bay etc. make it hard to follow. It seems that the characters of Slavers Bay and the Wildlings/Crows will be forgotten once the previously introduced main characters that are there move on in life or death. They are only in bulk to be thought of as one large character kind of like the Wights or the Dragons. I found myself feeling like the proverbial ""are we there yet"" kids.The whole split chronology is a detriment as well. It means that almost half the characters are not reacting or participating in any of the events of the other half, splendid isolation in time and place. Are the messenger crows not working here? This splitting is one reason why this novel is so unfocused it's almost as if Martin is just adding stuff to keep his page count up. The constant retelling of the near past is annoying. He could have written Parts 4 and 5 as one book and cut out a lot of unnecessary details and people that showed up in Part 5. This wouldn't have worked for the marketing dept. though: the release schedule and premier dates dictate too much. I think that's part of why he keeps changing the number of books. I wouldn't be surprised if he extended it to 10 books. We may have a new LOST on our hands here!I have to say that it's a definite liability that this and it's sequels are being fleshed out while a TV show is being produced of the series. This all smells too much of marketing to me, wasn't it around the start of Season 2 TV show that this novel debuted? Was the series even extended simply for cash and future TV seasons? I think this makes the rest of the books very reactive and subservient to the needs of HBO(the dragons largely disappear conveniently must be a TV/graphics budget issue) and weakens Martins credibility as a writer: but I guess once a TV writer always a TV writer. It's almost as if you should just skip the first 500-700 pages and just read the rest to get the gist of the novel. So, the next novel will be released in April 201X(near TV premiere time) or thereabouts I'm sure. There isn't even a preview of the next novel in this one at the end like the first four books, ominous sign that.In short it's worth a read but don't expect the tight focused story of the first four or the introduction of any new characters you'll care much about."

I decided to test my theory that no matter how good a book or symphony or painting or aria or whatever have you, someone somewhere is going to think it is a piece of crap. I have observed this phenomenon in my one thousand plus speaking engagements where typically I will receive hundreds of glowing reviews and then there will be one disgruntled person who thinks I should be thrown out the window or fed to the alligators.Here you have my favorite novel from a lifetime of reading voraciously -- Hemingway's FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS. A novel that has it all: story, character, historical background, description, dialogue, love story, thematic subtext. And above all that, it is pure poetry. And yet in reading the reviews on Amazon, I see not merely one but several poor souls who just never got it. One lady had to keep a dictionary next to her to get through Hemingway's vocabulary. Too many syllables for her, I guess. (How many syllables are there in ""ignoramus?"") One example of how subjective it all is: Hemingway writes as though he is speaking Spanish even though he is writing in English. I am in awe of his ability to do this, and in fact one of the reviewers, a native Spanish speaker, confirms that Hemingway is perfectly accurate in his translation. Still, another brilliant reviewer doesn't get it, thinks that Hemingway must be illiterate.Am I being a snob? I prefer not to think so. I just think it illustrates a wonderful quality of human beings, that they can and will disagree on just about anything. I simply want it to be known that this reviewer gives this book a ten-star review. More than any movie, FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS makes the hair stand up on the back of my neck. The reaction is visceral (look that up in your dictionary). If you have not read it, don't wait -- order the damn thing right away. It will enrich your life beyond description...or not!"

It was simultaneously boring, cliched, badly written and trite. Oh and repetitive. The only redeeming feature of the book was the parts where Jacob was an old man. If the author could write like that more consistently then she would be on to something. I cannot figure out why people love this book so much. If you compare it to another recently very popular book, The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, at least that book was riveting, even though it was also not very well written. I am not looking for Faulkner, but if a book is not high literature it should at least have a compelling plot. This book had neither neither good writing style nor an interesting plot.

Im glad I didn't have to wait six years for this one like some people did. Now that I read it, I understand why many were disappointed. Its rather a bloated book. For one thing there is way too much description of family shields, clothing worn, and Westeros history - descriptions that if you read the previous four books, you already know for the most part. Way too much time was spent describing the various difficulties in traveling; yes, we get it, people get seasick a lot. Is it necessary to describe it each time it happens? The sections that take place off Westeros included way too many characters to keep track of. I found myself bored often and skimmed most of these sections (tho the part where Dany finally gets to fly was breathtaking). I also had trouble with the timeline - just how much time has passed here, and just how old are some of these leaders? Are Dany and Jon really only 15 or so? No wonder things are so screwed up. I did enjoy reading about Bran and Arya, but then they were sort of dropped and never heard of again. I loved that Cersei finally gets whats been coming to her for a long time, and loved Tyrion, as always. But he sorely needed an editor in this book, more so than any of his other books in the series. If it had been tighter narrative, this easily could have been a 4 star.That all being said - this was another page turner. I was hooked from the beginning, and while there were some sections I skimmed through, the story certainly kept my attention. As usual, he is a genius in characer development, and in showing the different facets of each character. I also appreciated of the new maps, but I wished he had made a character list in abc order, instead of by families, for easy reference. Hoping the next book happens soon, with tying up"

I read &quot;Moby Dick&quot; and did not find it boring. I read &quot;Bleak House&quot; and did not find it boring. I read &quot;Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire&quot; and did not find it boring. But &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot; is, well, boring. Here's why: I never gave a damn for this Hemingway hero Robert Jordan. He seems like a pretty aimless tough guy, making love every fifth chapter and cussing around trying to be cool. The ending was entirely unsatisfactory - we end up having gone just about nowhere. Fortunately, Pilar is an interesting character who adds some spice to the proceedings. The only real point to this novel seems to be conveyed by its fine title, a reference to a John Donne poem. Loosely, the poem conveyed the idea that whatever happens to any human being ought perhaps to be the business of all of us. In the case of the novel, Hemingway draws attention to the largely overlooked Spanish Civil War and its suffering. But he does so with the title page alone; the rest of these 400 pages add little to this noble premise. Hemingway needs a better plot to devote his fine style to."

The story is mildly interesting, entertaining,and entirely predictable. The characters were shallow, not well developed, but the story moves along quickly enough so this is not a big distraction.

It was strongly recommended to me by several people who said it was ""a great story"" so I was expecting something that would truly captivate me and pull me in. For me, it simply fell short.I think that a tremendous amount of time and effort went into the research involved for this book and that should not go unnoticed. If you're looking for a book that clearly depicts the Great Depression and/or circus life during that time period - by all means you should pick up the book. I do not know a tremendous amount about that time period to tell you if it was fully accurate, but I feel that it did give me a pretty good picture of what circus life would be like in that era. The photographs installed at the beginning of each chapter also did a great job connecting the story with the reality of traveling circuses of the time. The language probably could have corresponded a bit more, but in terms of the spirit and energy of the book versus the time period in which it takes place, I think it was pretty spot on.However, I really had trouble connecting with the characters. They simply did not seem like well-rounded, real people to me. I understand that the characters should be eccentric considering they are individuals traveling with a circus, but not to the point where they should seem artificial. Their emotional reactions to various tumultuous situations seemed unrealistic - based on having experienced similar situations in my life. The psychological repercussions would have been huge for a lot of the major conflicts that occur in the book - especially during the time of the Great Depression - but I did not feel the degree of inner struggle within the characters was well represented throughout the story. The characters would get sad or angry, but they seemed to sedate their feelings pretty darn quick.The depiction of the main character in his old age, however, seemed more realistic to me. I thought the scenes in the nursing home were very well done and true to life. The characters in these parts also seemed more believable to me. However, I was pretty disappointed in the ending. It seemed contrived. I will not get into it too deeply, however, so as not to spoil the story.I genuinely feel that Sara Gruen is a great author and did a good job with the book, I just feel that the character development was lacking. In terms of painting a picture of the environment though, she did a fantastic job and it's a book worth reading, if only for the descriptive element of it. Plus, tons of people simply LOVE the book - it just wasn't for me in the end."

OF COURSE you have to read it.My favorite characters may be dead, missing or enslaved, but of course I had to read it. I waited a bloody long time (years) to sink my teeth in. The only book that took longer was the newest Jean M. Auel book (and don't read that.)Was it great literature?? Eh. The first book, second book, and third book rip you to shreds and sew you back up. Even BETTER than Tolkien, dare I say it? The 4th book just hurt me like a punch in the gut, and then I had to wait. I had a baby when I started reading these, and now she's nearly 6.This read is a little confusing, and as he says it goes back in time, but you get serious deja vu. When you finally catch up to Arya and Cersei and a few others again, they have small sections (maybe 2 chapters each in a book of over 900 pages) This would be okay if the other sections were written to be MORE interesting.But mein gott. I cannot believe how many horses were eaten because of how many people are stuck in the snow.I like the emergence of some of the wildlings, I love Jon Snow and the watch, want Tyrion to be king, I adore Danaerys (but I'm not a fan of the story as it goes into the slave cities and she sort of pitches her tent and waits for war and disease.) I'm not too interested in Dorne, could care less about the Iron Islands, and don't really understand what is going on with Bran and the froggy kids (I was really hoping for elves or something, and what happens is actually weirder.) There are some new characters you might like if you miss Ned Stark, like the lord of Griffin's Roost. And you'll actually feel sorry for Theon a little.It's worth a read if you are a hardcore fan. It's not that enlightening or riveting a book unless you are addicted, so if you're not actually in pain from not reading it? You can wait to borrow instead of buying it outright. The library wait will be about 2 years, so no whining, we waited for 5.I really like the maps. I find myself flipping to the map pages to help me visualize where people are.

I have read `em high and... low. There are times when I just want an escapist read. But given the perimeters--those reads usually deliver the goods. Though the stories may be a tad simple.Here we have a book that's been out a while. Supposedly one with some substance. So we have a guy who winds up joining the circus after ditching an Ivy league education in the Depression years. I can go with it. No problem there. But then we have the host of characters in the circus itself. Some of this is good reading--but then--we have problems of cliched, predicatable writing wedged between sections of rather better-than-average writing. And all too many flat characters with little substance.Much of this appears in this story. That's the problem. Besides, Jacob is just not all that engaging to me or a convincing character. And the story comes off predictable and rather weak. So it's a passable beach read.Given the kind of over-the-top and unsubstantiated praise this novel has received, surely, I can't be the only one who feels this way and I can't help but notice than whenever there is a unfavorable review of this book there will be an outpouring of five star reviews--one after another--that are all two or three sentences of praise and little real commentary.Coincidence?Again, not an altogether bad read, but this is no KITE RUNNER or actually, SNOW FLOWER AND THE SECRET FAN, two far better reads than this."

Robinson's writing is literally bursting with ideas and his descriptions of the political developments among Martian colonists who as time goes by have less and less in commom with the Earth the left behind rings absolutely true.

One is the present day, real-life existance of elderly residents in an assisted living facility. Their story is told through the eyes of a ""90-something"" year old man recuperating from a broken hip. At the same time, this character, Jacob we learn is his name, regales us with life as a member of a circus from the past. Both stories are filled with such strong detail that we as the reader, are drawn back and forth from the past to the present in gentle surprise. We are introduced to the emotional roller-coaster details of a young man's life, many of which he is not a willing participant. However, we learn that he has a depth of character and courage that carries him through life's troubles when many of us today would want to give up. We find him using those same character traits to overcome some ""curve-ball throws"" that at ""93"", life is still pitching his way. Ms. Gruen has done a superb job of blending the past and present, and even gives us a hint of the future of this gallant man's life. Her book is so well researched that the reader might begin to feel it is a biography rather than fiction. This book will hold your interest throughout, especially the tales of the circus from a by-gone era and even the unfortunate activities of life in elder-care facilities that haunt us today. However, she does not leave us feeling sad and remiss about a touchy subject, but instead gives us a surprise ending that is upbeat and hopeful.By: Sherry M. Airey"

If you're a pragmatist you will love the research and facts concerning the circus of the depression era. If a romantic, the ending will be for you. If you are young, the choices and frustrations suffered by Jacob will be yours. For me, a senior citizen, the gerentology added greatly to the story.I thought it a great read especially since there are 70 years between the youth and aged of the story which is told in flashback form. There is little in common between the two periods of time except for love and the anticipation of all ages.Try it, you will like it."

Or, if you like stuff like King Arthur, Merlin, Medieval Times, Tolkein, then you will enjoy. Just an epic adventure!With the sex and violence comes the caution that these books are NOT for kids. I think I would say 18+ on the books if your children are asking for them.Only critique is that there are SO many characters added, and so many places in the realm, I sometimes find myself referring back to another book or to the maps (which can be kind of fun too!).

We've invested hours and pages in characters and plotlines, only to have brand new characters introduced...AGAIN... and a character we are invested in killed off because GRRM doesn't know what else to do with them.I was hoping to find Dance With Dragons have more focus and development on Jon, Arya, Bran and their wolves, Tyrion, Cersie, Jamie, and Dany and Sam. Was I disappointed? In the end - yes, big time. (possible spoiler ahead)I got a lot of back & forth with Dany and Meeren and almost no development of her relationship with the dragons or who else may ride them.I got bits of Arya's growth, but not much and only toward the end of the book.Bran - a few chapters of odd situations that seemed like filler and a way to put him aside.Jon got chapters about his dealings with Wildings and Stannis, but not the Others or Ghost.Cersie - chapters toward the end of the book ending in her being marginalized and set aside.Jamie - one chapter only!Sam - nothingTyrion - Hurray! Some interesting bits of intrigue but not what I was hoping for.New people - lots and lots and I didn't care about any of them at all.I loved books 1 & 2 and they got me hooked on this series. Book 3 was annoying at times, but I stuck with it. Book 4 was a dissappointment because of the new characters, but I gave it a chance & held out hope for this book.

I became a fan with the first and I'm trying to still be a fan, but it's really hard.Expect each chapter to go into details of superfulous things, to be repeatable, and, worst of all, boring. In this last book the author has started to spend a lot of words in useless drama and finishing the chapter when something really happens. Then he skips all the things that happened so you go forward in time to when someone is remembering what happened. Boring and tedious.Another important thing is that the author also goes to the next level in sexual references. And the repetitive use of phrases and words also is tiresome.If you find a book that summirizes this one, get it. This book can be made to two pages per chapter easily.

I felt that Book 4 was all over the place and I was a bit worried about where the series was going after finishing Book 4. There is still a lot of bouncing around in Book 5, but Martin did a good job of keeping his story lines fairly clear. This was something that I found lacking in Book 4. I feel that he is falling into the same trappings that Robert Jordan fell into with his Wheel of Time series. There are too many characters and there's almost too much going on to keep track of, but to me, that spells out a great series and it means that there will be many more books in this series to enjoy.The plot lines that I am most looking forward to in the next book are: Arya, Tyrion, Cersei, Daenarys, and Jamie and Brienne.Martin is great at delivering shocking twists in his plot lines, and Book 5 proves to be no exception. Those twists all happened at the end of the book, but I suppose that is the point. I'm definitely more than ready to the next book in the series."

So I gave it a go and, after a slow start, was interested enough to finish. The author does everything she can to exploit the reader's concern for cats, dogs, monkeys and, of course, the titular elephant. The narrator is a vet who sticks with the circus, at first, in order to protect the animals, but he does little to interfere with their mistreatment... or the mistreatment of his fellow humans. In that sense, the book rings false. The book exploits the reader's feeling for animals and animal-human relationships for some cheap emotional effect. And it worked on me to some extent because I cared about (and shed shed tears for) the animals much more than the humans. But I fail to see larger point."

The first half of the story (the first book) was a bit slow at first and I was reluctant to continue on, however it soon picked up pace and I couldn't put it down. The story was heart-rending and I became sympathetic to all of the main characters and felt disdain towards the antagonists, just as the protagonists felt. I recommend this book to anyone who loves America and the struggle to gain freedom in a time when hope seemed far in the distance. This book will enliven the American spirit. I am sure that ""War and Remembrance"" will be just as well-written as ""The Winds of War"" and I look forward to reading how the character's lives end up. Read This!"
5,3.1,0.99705,2017,03-01,7418100,The Groovy Smoothie Café,El Paso,,Marquette,East,10,"I had no anticipation of what to expect when I began reading Water for Elephants. The most enlightening aspect of the story was the education I received about the hierarchy of employees within the circus. From an outsider who has always been taught (but never believed it) that people in the circus where of lower class than others, I had no idea there were different ranks of people within the circus. Life behind the scenes at the circus was crude and inhumane. From the beginning the book was colorful with characters. The transitioning between the past and the present with the main character was an interesting transition.I try to approach a book with an open mind and throw other opinions out the window. I am pleased I have done this because the people that I know who have read this book have ranged from horrible to excellent. I found this book entertaining and engrossing. It was never a book that I just could not put down, but I enjoyed read it. Because the era in which the reference of the circus occurred the comparison of food lines and the great depression was evident. Although the inhumane treatment of the people and animals undoubtedly occurred during this time period, it wasn't easy to read it. Although the hierarchy of the class of people was evident within the circus, it was not unlike how society actually was during this time period. The author clearly did research to solidly base the sad realities of the treatment of people and animals during the depression era.The author weaved a story with vivid characters and animal characters in a sympathetic and favorable light. Sara Gruen's engaging ""Water for Elephants"" is an eminently American work, set in the depths of the Depression and featuring a broken-hearted young man whose unplanned existential leap of faith catapults him into a chaotic and unknown way of life. Jacob Jankowski discovers his untapped reservoir of courage, conviction and compassion, and in so doing, he, in every manner of the American definition of the word, emerges as a hero. ""Water for Elephants"" is a triumph -- of a writer fully in control of her craft, of a character resolute in his determination to discover life and of a depiction of ideas that truly embody our national character.After all of this being said, I am on the fence as to whether this book lives up to all the buzzes and even deserving of being made a movie. There is nothing more satisfying than when you finish a book and you feel like you also were part of the adventure. I do not regret reading this book, I only wish it was more engrossing."

I can understand anyone with a passion for the circus or the 1930's getting excited about it but for the average reader it has nothing special to offer so I am shocked by the positive attention and time on the best sellers list this book has generated. Without giving any spoilers away let me say the book is very cliched and predictable and the leading human characters are all undeveloped and quite stereotyped. The animals are perhaps given a little more rounded personalities. The circus portion of the story ends in a fantastic and unbelievable manner and the other story in which our hero is now an old man in a nursing home ends in just as unlikely manner. Others have commented on the great cover and I wonder if that is responsible for the surprising success of this book. THE CIRCUS IN WINTER by Cathy Day which came out a couple of years ago is a much better written book and is just as well researched with a very similar setting.

Most people I've talked to say this book is just so so. Most people on here have written that this book is &quot;amazing&quot;, or &quot;Clancy's best&quot;. I'll agree with the former; the latter will always be up to debate.This book is different than the typical Clany novel in two ways.1) It doesn't feature Jack Ryan.2) It's a personal story.The first point is self explanitory, but the second may need clarification. Those that have read Clancy's other works understand his strenghts: weaving interesting characters in a technical environment designing thick plotlines that span global environments (that may have sounded dumb but it's true).Without Remorse is none of that. It's the story of one man and his quest for vengence. It's also an exploration of whether or not can be justified. Clancy keeps pushing the envelope, baraging the character(s) with events that will test even the most forgiving person's morals. Is vigilanteism justified? I've never read a book that poses as many arguments for it. And yet, even after Clancy makes every excuse in the world to justify Clarks actions in the book, he plainly and tastefully keeps the book as a whole objective, never glorifying violence.In the setting of Clark's quest for vengeance we also get to witness Clancy writing in a more intimate and emotional fashion. The book rarely strays from Clarks point of view (a first for this writer who is known for bouncing all over the place). The story really moved me emotionally a few times as Clancy unfolded the lives of the characters (almost cried in one part).People expecting stereotypical Clancy may be disappointed by this departure, but don't be mistaken; this is a fine book in it's own right. Never have I been more impressed with Clancy's writing.Why only four stars then? Well because honestly the book is not as strong on the plot department as most Clancy books, and the ending is not as climactic as Clancy readers have come to expect. This isn't to say the book is weak in those departments; just not that strong. The other strengths of this book help make up this novel's 'very good' (4 star) rating."

Throughout the course of the book you see Jake in the nursing home and Jake in the past. Jake in the nursing home is looking forward to seeing the circus which has come to town. But first he has to deal with a couple more days until that time comes and you learn a little bit of what his like is like in the nursing home. He's not too happy and he every once in awhile starts to reminisce what it was like when he was much younger and he became part of a circus. Since he had been in veterinary school before stowing away on the circus train he ends up being put in charge of the animals. One of which is an elephant. The elephant is not treated well at all and Jake even becomes frustrated with it until the day he realizes that the elephant doesn't understand commands because he learned them in another language. Once that barrier is broken he and the elephant end up developing a close relationship as he's about the only one who actually treats the animals with any compassion and care. He also falls in love with Marlena who is married to the very temperamental ring master. Considering the time period of the book, it's quite possible that her husband suffered from manic depression as the man's mood swings go from very happy to incredibly abusive and destructive. Over the course of the book we find out more of what happened between Jake and his elephant and also what happened with him and Marlena.Throughout the course of the book you learn a lot about what circuses were like back in the thirties. Sometimes a bigger circus would acquire a smaller circus and combine the two. A lot of times the workers went a long ways toward being paid. And sometimes the owners of the circus would scramble from opportunity to opportunity in order to have enough money to keep the circus running. And the performers traveled from city to city by train, which would have not only been hard on them but as the animals as well. If you like animals this can be a difficult book to read from time to time, but it's a fascinating look at circuses that I enjoyed the book very much anyway. Someday I may get the sequel to find out more of what happened to Jake both past and present."

It has been awhile since a book has had that type of impact on me. This book was excellent.I never really thought of the circus being around during the Great Depression. Everytime people hear 'Great Depresion' people automatically think of the soup kitchens and as Ms. Gruen put it 'hobo jungles'. I was pleased to learn a little bit about the circus during this time period and learn that there were harsh treatments and conditions of the animals AND workers in this book (which is horrible because I love animals, and people shouldn't be treated like nothing). I have read a few reviews regarding the volgar and violent content of the book. Let's face it, this is what happened (or at least similar to what was so to say). There were no strict enforcements on labor law or even animal laws such as PETA back then. This was life; workers and performers thought of it as such. It is unpleasant to read and even learn about but it was a different time and a different world. Just like other tragic times in history (wars, genocides, slavery, etc.). As for the volgar parts, like the sexual scenes, just part of life back then too and I suppose Ms. Gruen wanted it to be properly formatted.This book is very descriptive, and emotional, has an excellent plot and an unexpected ending. This was unlike any other endings to be honest, and I was shocked and pleased with it. The pauses between young Jacob and old Jacob got me too, just because I feel sorry for old Jacob and happy he's able to go back to an important time to him. Got you thinking about the people in those situations who have nobody left and feel like a burden to your family just to come visit.If you are looking for a love story, happy ending and action book, this book is for you! :) Five stars!"

Like Jacob, I longed for the times when his mind slipped back to his younger years when his body was whole and his mind sharp, when his passions ran high and his life was full of adventure. I could relate to his frustration with his age, mental status and physically limitations.The story of his life was emotional, and felt very real. The ending was surprisingly satisfying for the reader and Jacob, possibly because Jacob received what we all hope for at the end of a long life. I'm not going to say anymore than that, as i dont want to give anything away so if you want to know more you will have to read it yourself. I hope you enjoy this book as much as I did."

4,3.41,1,2006,03-02,9713500,Shophouse Southeast Asian Kitchen,Rockville,$,NC State,South,10,"1975's ""Circus"" is a suspenseful Cold War thriller by master story teller Alistair MacLean, featuring a popular circus on tour in an unnamed Eastern European country. As in many of Maclean's novels, practically none of the characters are exactly who they seem to be, while the espionage mission, to steal the secret plans for an exotic anti-matter weapon, is only one item on a seemingly crowded agenda.The hero of the story is one Bruno Wilderman, Eastern European expatriate and master circus aerialist. He is asked by the CIA to break into the Lubyian Prison in the city of Crau in order to steal the above-mentioned plans. The only access to the prison may be a near suicidal aerial traverse of a three hundred yard long electrical cable nine stories in the air. To complicate the plot, the sudden deaths of two CIA agents before the circus even leaves the United States indicate the enemy is onto the plot. The trails of mysterious deaths will follow the circus across the Atlantic and into Eastern Europe. Wilderman, nominally under the direction of the CIA's Dr. Harper and his beautiful young assistant Maria, soon learns that he will have to make his own plans if he hopes to survive the mission.The premise for the story is solid, but the plot too often devolves into ""they know that we know that they know that we know"" shannigans. The mission is immediately compromised, and the reader is asked to believe that Wilderman can put together his own effort to break into the Lubyian, one worthy of a ""Mission Impossible"" episode, under the noses of both the CIA and the Secret Police in Crau. MacLean fans will sense that he was to some degree going through the motions on another spy thriller, but to his credit, MacLean keeps the surprises coming to the very last page.""Circus"" is recommended to fans of Alistair Maclean as an entertaining read."

The Allies who prosecuted the Pacific War held trials of Japan's war leaders on the same legal basis as those of the Nazis following the end of WWII. This book, written by a reporter who was present during the proceedings, looks at international law and the violations of it while Japan attempted to take over Asia. Also, the Japanese government's involvment in narcotics trafficing and both large-scale and small-scale atrocities directed at the civilian populations and POWs was addressed during the trials.While imperfect, the trials not only established the criminal behavior of Japan's government but determined the punishment of key leaders involved. The war guilt of Emperor Hirohito was never addressed (or addressed only obliquely) for political reasons while seven men were hanged for war crimes.A good read with some photos."

This week I finally finished forcing my way through Blue Mars, the last in the trilogy.The value of this trilogy is the comprehensive presentation of the social and technological dimensions of terraforming Mars over the course of about 200 years.If you are at all interested in Mars, you have to read these books, but if, like me, you find them to be slowgoing at times, somewhat agonizingly trite at others, and you would rather just absorb the terraforming ideas, I highly recommend that you skim skim skim. I wouldn't usually recommend this approach to a book, as you need to give the author every chance.There *are* some wonderfully created moments in characterization, but mostly the characters are formulaic and play off against each other mathematically. One is a meddling experimenter, another worships unadulterated rock and opposes any terraforming, another seeks to build a religion around Mars, another is charismatic, secular, not too bright, and a born leader, etc.But the terraforming ideas are usually very detailed and presented in a convincing manner embedded in a believable future history.

Clancy took a gamble on this knowing it would ultimately turn off some of his die hard Ryan fans, but if you pass this one up, you are losing out on quite a literary adventure. Only John Clark comes close to being as well developed as Ryan...but we have no idea about how he came to be who he is today, and more important, the WHY? 'Without Remorse' tells John's tale, which is far from a pretty one.John's tale begins during the Vietnam War and moves from one continent to another and show's us what John is made of, and why. He never set out to be John Clark (not his real name), in fact the events which transpire and ultimately force John to do the unthinkable are horrific indeed, but it makes you wonder what you would do given the same circumstances... I wouldn't go so far as to say I would actually do the same, but would I entertain the thought? Yeah, sure. What limits do we have as humans? We get to find out Clarks here in a decidedly different story than what we have come to expect from Clancy, and easily one of the better novels he has produced. I also very much enjoyed 'Rainbow Six' which seemed to be panned by many, but hey, I'm a BIG John Clark fan... 'Without Remorse' is a worthy addition to Clancy's great collection of works, and very worthwhile to buy and read."

What I fell in love with in his writing is all here, except his conciseness. This story could have been 200 pages shorter and all the better for it. But Hemingway was responding to critics that accused him of the very conciseness that made his other works a rhythmic masterpiece of storytelling narrative. Hemingway understood technique better than any writer, and why he let criticism overrule better judgment destroys the pace and rhythmic flow of this story. For a three day period, 470 pages is a lot of cave dwelling, talking, eating and drinking. The stories of Pilar while important also drag the story in pacing. Robert Jordan's train of thought - well let's just say that is a mighty long train. The relationship between Jordan and Maria is a quick and welcome breath of distraction from the mundane cave proceedings.This is still worthy of a read, but you are going to have to spend some time with it and, dare say, slug through some excessive chapters where the rhythm and flow of the story comes to a crawl."

Others have called this work simplistic, its title unrelated to the book's content, something to be idolized by high school English teachers. Ha! If you read only to be entertained, you will miss some of the most poignant features of the work.For me, the characters come alive in the book. They live and breathe as human beings most certainly did during the Spanish Revolution: Golz, Anselmo, El Sordo, Pablo, and Pilar. And although Robert Jordan's intimacy with Maria is cloaked in euphemisms to get it past the censors when the book was first written in 1939, I got the point: the two of them, as sometimes happens once or twice in life, were inexplicably drawn to each other. It's not something carnal or obscene; it's something divine, and that which one should be eternally thankful for. Certainly, Hemingway must have realized this when he created the characters of Robert and Maria.The ending was written some thirty-eight times in an attempt ""to get the words right,"" and that speaks volumes about the author's diligence in producing a work of literature that will last the ages. The love which Robert Jordan had for Maria is evidenced in his desire to see her safely away, to give up his life that she may move on and live her life. He knows he is ""mucked,"" yet he kindly but forcibly tells Maria they will always be together. Now, that's love!I give this work my highest rating."

Sadly, I think he was a little off of his game on this one. Maybe part of the problem was waiting so very long for this book. I may have gotten too much anxiety and expectation built up over the years as I waited for this book to come. Maybe another problem was that it seems this book was a transitional or ""calm-before-the-storm"" type of book. The first three books in this series while having multiple characters and multiple storylines, usually always had at least one important story that came to at least some sort of conclusion at the end of the book. This book was absent of any great climax. I THOUGHT there was one coming that events seemed to be leading up to for most of the book, but that storyline abruptly dies and left me feeling cheated.Don't get me wrong, the book was great! The characters are superb. I've grown to love many of them over the last few books. As always, Martin does a wonderful job of telling a story through the eyes of various characters each in a unique way. Rather than a 3rd person story that gives the readers facts and some insights into a broad range of characters, we see the events unfold via a personal viewpoint of different people. I think it does a better job of drawing the reader in as you experience events through each person's eyes, and feel their emotions as the drama unfolds. Sometimes we get to experience a common event through two different characters' eyes which is quite interesting. One complaint though is that the story is almost getting too big. The author keeps adding more characters, and I'm starting to reach my maximum amount of people that I care to keep track of. Also, some of the names in parts of the story such as Hizdahr Zo Loraq, Skahaz Mo Kandaq, and Reznak Mo Reznak start to run together after awhile.As usual with a Martin book, the world he creates is full of depth and detail. Every kingdom, city, family, etc. has a unique feel. It's so easy to become immersed in the story as if each place were a city that you visit all the time and every character is an old friend you've known all your life.It's surely a sign of good writing if my biggest problem is that I have grown to love the good guys so much and hate the bad guys so much that I'm getting a little impatient waiting for justice to finally come. I find myself continually hoping with each event that THIS is where the tide finally starts to turn, only to have my hopes crushed. If I look at the book as this setting in motion a string of events that will come to climax in the next book, I can be much more forgiving. However, if the storylines continue to veer off in ever-increasing paths with no end in sight, my patience is going to begin to wear thin. I have danced with the dragons long enough. It's time for this song to end and let the final battle begin!"

Exciting, romantic, adventurous and slightly sorrowful at times. The characters were unforgettable. I adore Jacob at age 21 (and age 93) and he is a wonderful protagonist.

I will say that the circus atmosphere was conveyed with incredible, and apparently accurate, detail and I was impressed by that. I could see and even smell everything, and the book movingly conveyed how desperate times led to desperate people clinging to even the most degrading employment with a third rate circus. However, the characters seemed to be straight out of a romance novel, with the exception of old(even he's not sure how old he is)Jacob, who was funny, disarming, feisty and touching -- whereas the young Jacob was pretty vanilla, too obviously a ""nice guy"" with little personality. In contrast, Old Jacob's voice was so clear and true and I really cared about him;he was funny and sad, his memories bittersweet, his longings compelling. I also liked (but who didn't?)Rosie the elephant, who had twice the personality of anyone else in the fleabag circus, with the exception perhaps of Walter, the dwarf. The plot depended on coincidences that I had problems believing, and I found myself caring more about the animals (which I admit isn't unusual for me!) than I did about any of the people. However, I'd heartily recommend this book to anyone who enjoys sentimental stories, who loves happy, pat endings, who doesn't necessarily want a book to convey great ideas, but who is touched more by the romance rather than the writing. Those of you will, as have many others, it appears, love this book. There is certainly nothing wrong with that, it's just that those kinds of books are simply not what I prefer to read. This book might actually make a good movie, and I'd be surprised if Hollywood hasn't snatched it up already."

Yes, the details about circus life were interesting, and the romance was gripping in a kind of 1930s way. But there were a lot of things that didn't make sense to me (circuses are going broke right and left, but the star performers appear rich, wearing tuxedos and drinking champagne), and for my money the bad guys were too bad and the good guys too entirely good. The minor characters (the little person, the hootch dancer, etc.) were more complete than the leads.It would make a heckuva film though - drama, chase scenes on the top of train cars, etc.I also confess that the audio version may have added to my bad humor - there was one fellow playing the older narrator who was really superb, but the fellow reading the part of the young hero was whiny in the extreme (what did she see in him?."

Eat lots of fruits and vegetables. Meat is fine but make sure you have more whole grains on your plate. Emphasize variety and balance in your diet. Avoid processed foods, especially those high in fat, sugar, and salt. Exercise. There are no miracle foods and short cuts to a healthy diet.That's great advice that comes at page 353 of this 355-page book. I have many issues with the structure of the book, the main being Dr. Schwarcz's decision to divide his book into easily digestible chapters tackling all the major food debates out there: organic, genetically modified, detox, and so on. It would have been a much better book if Dr. Schwarcz structured it around his main thesis: that there are no short cuts to a healthy diet.Science has spent decades and billions of dollars analyzing the different components of food in the hope of distilling the magical qualities of apples and tomatoes, and selling it in a bottle. There is no scientific basis for the overwhelming superiority of a certain vitamin, chemical, or nutritional supplement. Quite the opposite: eating or drinking too much of a good thing can be a bad thing. Seeking balance, moderation, and variety in nutrition is the best and only path to good health."

I love all of Hemingway's extensive body of works, but this novel is by far my favourite. The story is about a young American man who is fighting voluntarily against Franco's Fascist forces in Spain. This man ends up leading a band of guerillas in what turns out to be a totally useless military foray. The novel itself only encompasses seventy-two hours, but in that time Robert Jordan, our American hero, loses his comrades in battle, falls in love, and is badly wounded. Hemingway's writing is masterful in this classic! This book, even more than ""A Farewell to Arms"" outlines Hemingway's thoughts on the futility of war, and the effect that war has on one single man. Even though the novel encompasses such a short time, Hemingway makes use of flashbacks to bring the reader into the series of events that led to this particular point in Jordan's life. Again, Hemingway makes use of personal experiences for this novel. He was actually involved himself in this Spanish civil war. His writing style is spare, although incredibly vivid. This is a truly wonderful book, that I feel encompasses all the best of Ernest Hemingway."

I kept hearing great things about it, but I just had no interest in reading about a circus. Then I saw the movie preview... and knew I wanted to read the book before seeing the movie (I'm rarely able to finish a book if I see the movie first). So I started reading, and had a hard time getting into it at first... I think this was mainly because I felt like I HAD to read the book... as if I was back in school! I eventually got past this and was able to get immersed into Water for Elephants.Usually, I rate books by how I feel while reading them, so my ratings are normally always subjective. In this case, I felt I had to give this book 5 stars based on the fantastic writing and the amazingly rich and unique backdrop of the train circus! It is obvious that the author did her research on circus culture and depression-era American history. She really dug into the down and dirty details of circus life. In the discussion after the last chapter you learn that many things in the story are based on true stories or anecdotes of the circus. The Bezini Brothers train circus is easily like another character in the book, flawed and deeply layered, like the characters themselves. I really liked how the story is told from Jacob's perspective as a spunky 93 year old man, having flashbacks of his life 70 year earlier. The altering perspectives (from young to old) effectively grounded the story and added another layer to his character.At times, this wasn't easy to read... It was sad to read about the indignities of being old, and I felt like Gruen's depiction was honest and very real. Though most of all, I had a really hard time reading some of the scenes with the animals. At one point I caught myself reading between my fingers, as if I was trying to block the scene from view as if it was a movie. I tried skipping over one but I had to go back and read it because I felt like it was important to the development of the characters and the story. It was, and they were. I just wish those scenes hadn't been seemingly timed to when I was getting ready to go to sleep.Seriously, I'm so glad I finally picked up this book. I highly recommend it!"

A very large percentage of the novel is devoted to landscape descriptions like this, or the science background to the geological/terraforming events. Perhaps you're looking into Red Mars for the same reason I chose to give it a read--it won some prestigious awards. Having just finished the book, I can say that it won those awards on the strength of the large amounts of research that obviously went into its creation.While I applaud those efforts as well, it is also possible that you're like me in that you're seeking a good story with an exciting plot and well-drawn, sympathetic characters. In those respects, Red Mars is quite a disappointment. The characters are fairly flat and, save for the ones that die, they essentially are the same from beginning to end. Further, none are particularly endearing; by the end, I did not care much what happened to them, or who succeeded, or who failed. The plot begins promisingly enough, but once past the first couple hundred pages it begins to meander off, neither building tension nor resolving anything.Part of the problems lie in the fact that the author wants his story to be ""epic."" Thus, he tells the story over several decades. The problem with this approach is that it distances us from the characters and the plot. There is no sense of immediacy. Also, it underlines the unchanging nature of the characters--surely someone could develop a new insight over thirty years? Further, the pacing is horrendous, punctuated as it is by all of the landscape details as noted above. The truth is that Mars does not have a particularly interesting landscape, being mostly rock and sand. The author tries his darndest to make it interesting, describing it at length, and he occasionally succeeds, but it just becomes frustrating after about page 300. As a parting slap, he makes the last 40 pages or so just about nothing *but* landscape description... sort of a final exam, I suppose. It is alienating and loses whatever interest the events in the story generate.Lastly to discuss is the philosophy of the piece. I got the impression, throughout, that the author is presenting two extreme sides of an issue (terraforming)--radical environmentalism (Ann) and radical, ""meddling"" science/humanism (Sax)--and saying that there must be some sort of compromise we can manage. The only real villain is capitalism (Phyllis/transnational corporations); otherwise, the author wants to be the voice of moderation. Sadly, the author displays very little real sympathy for any of the viewpoints presented and no understanding for those who would genuinely disagree with what he believes to be moderation (a strange form of socialism). His arguments will only seem right to you if you agree with him beforehand. The tone of the writing is clinical. Its prognosis for humanity, bleak.In all, I'm certain this book has an audience. After all, it has several glowing reviews here and did win those awards for some good reason, no doubt. It represents a mountain of research and, I am sure, painstaking work. Perhaps you are a part of its audience. I am not. The things I look for in a novel include exciting plots, engaging pacing and well-drawn, sympathetic characters who grow and change over the course of the story. This novel fails in those respects. There are two sequels but my journey ends here."

I don't know that I like it any better or any worse than A Feast for Crows, which was my least-favourite book of the series thus far. And I was, if not expecting, at least hoping to like this one a lot better, because I so many more of my favourite characters were in this one. And there were certainly parts I enjoyed a lot. But there were a lot of parts that frustrated me, a lot of parts that bored me, and a lot of parts that felt completely extraneous. It's definitely in need of judicious editing. I sort of get the feeling that his editors, so happy to have him finally declare it finished, didn't actually spend much time editing before sending it to print. Apart from a lot of unnecessary repetition and a lot of extraneous material, I also found five typos.So, overall -- I'm giving this 3.5 because I just sort of don't know what to do with it. There were quite a few moments that genuinely excited me. But there were a lot of things that frustrated me, that needed editing, or that should've been held off till the next book. And there are so many things left unanswered, so many arcs that began in this book or in Feast that have yet to see any kind of fulfillment whatsoever...

This was my first major Hemingway and, so far from finding it direct and pithy, as the author is reputed to be, I thought it tedious and repetitive, turgid in its inner monologues, and astoundingly old-fashioned in its dialogues. And yet, and yet.... Hemingway, who saw the Spanish Civil War from the inside as a reporter, has a remarkable gift for describing places such as a guerilla camp in the high mountains, capturing the undertones between people who do not really trust one another, evoking the tension before a dangerous action, then setting out the course of that action in simple concrete terms. My reading accelerated as it went on, and in the end I could hardly put the book down.I turned to this after reading a much more recent book about that war, Dave Boling'sGUERNICA. Despite the more approachable style of the later writer, Hemingway clearly has the larger vision. Whereas Boling writes a sweeping family saga, Hemingway confines himself to a three-day period in a single area. The hero, Robert Jordan, is an American instructor from a college in Montana fighting the fascists with the International Brigade. He is sent behind enemy lines to blow up a bridge spanning a mountain gorge. To do so, he must recruit the aid of local guerrilla bands, who may or may not trust him or each other. From this simple assignment, the scope spans out in thought and flashback to a much wider canvas, not so much of place and time but of moral vision. For Hemingway (clearly anti-fascist, but no card-carrying red either) is concerned at every turn with human dignity, the liberty which makes this possible, the love and hope which makes it worthwhile, and the apparent impossibility of preserving these values in wartime. This is a novel of substance.Unfortunately, neither Hemingway nor Boling avoids the temptation to romanticize the common people of another culture. Most of Hemingway's guerrillas are two-dimensional at best, and rather difficult to tell apart. The exceptions are Pablo, the once-fearless leader now turned cautious, and his wife Pilar. But Maria, the rape-survivor with whom Robert falls in love (or at least into bed), is a male fantasy of eager compliance; he even addresses her as ""little rabbit""! Worst of all is Hemingway's extraordinary decision to render spoken Spanish by means of an exaggeratedly literal translation, leading to lines such as: ""And what thinkest thou of this of the bridge?"" and the immortal post-coital question: ""Didst not thou feel the earth move?"" And his description of the act itself, a breathless homage to James Joyce and Gertrude Stein, may be a literary tour-de-force, but in that simple context it is laughably overblown. Hemingway had a better connection than most to people's souls and the movement of the earth; if only he did not go to such lengths to prove it!"

I suspect it got the award for its detailed description of Mars and its terraforming, not for its quality as a novel per se.1. Unity: Poor. Many scenes and dialogues in the book serve no purpose. For example, an entire chapter contains the musings of a psychologist about a personality theory that simply does not fit into the narrative. The character is barely heard from before the chapter, and barely heard from after.2. Narration: Poor. The book switches narrators frequently: one is from one character's point of view, the other from another's. This makes everything disjointed and ununified. Worse, the thoughts and feelings of each are strangely similar. One gets all of the detriment without any of the benefit of this musical chairs narration.3. Plot structure: Poor. There is snappy opening chapter with most the rest of the book as a flashback, but the rest has barely any structure. Sometimes the author is merely digressing into Martian geography. The ""climax"" towards the end is an excruciatingly long description of a flood. I thought it would never end. When it did, the novel was over. It was disappointingly anticlimactic.4. Plausibility: Poor. The story starts in 2026 with no account of why Earth has suddenly decided to inundate Mars with thousands of colonists and gigantic robots. I had to force myself to believe it was starting in 2126. The immense expense of such an operation in 2026 is completely unbelievable. 100 permanent colonists, followed a few years later by 1000?! Within 30-40 years, there are a million people on Mars and a space elevator. Outrageous. Worse, there is little to no political structure to the planet: there is only anarchy. Earth is willing to invest the majority of its GDP in a far-off planet but is indifferent about governing the people there...?5. Scientific accuracy: suspicious. The author speaks of ""degrees Kelvin."" There are no degrees in the Kelvin scale, only in Centigrade and Fahrenheit. I learned this in high school chemistry, which Stanley-Robinson apparently never had.6. Dependencia economics: a joke. The highly educated scientists that were the first colonists preach pure dependencia economics. They say that rich countries (the North) stripped the poor countries (the South) of everything worthwhile they had and continue to enslave them by trade. Big companies are too powerful and can manipulate governments. They highjack the economy to exploit everyone but themselves. Rank neo-Marxism and laughable. Stanley-Robinson has never had a course in economics, I'd bet.7. Length: Poor (700 pp.). I lost interest half-way through and finished just to be done with it. Some passages I had to skim."

R. James' classic story, ""Casting the Runes."" The plot is pretty well identical to Tourneur's creepy masterpiece, only updated and relocated from England to the hills of West Virginia.Long-distance trucker Josh Spiller finds himself off the beaten track in an oddly affluent little mountain town called Furnace, where a woman cold-bloodedly pushes an infant in its stroller in front of his eighteen-wheeler. The local constabulary are in no doubt it was an accident, but they don't believe his story about the woman pushing the baby - Spiller's description of her is that of their town benefactoress and councillor, Nelly McFarlane.Stymied, Spiller leaves town and picks up a teenaged girl hitchhiker named Griffin, who is anxious to leave Furnace because she considers it a bad place, though she won't say precisely why. Soon, Spiller notices diabolical phenomena following him around - sulfurous smells, evil apparitions, claw marks in his truck - and the discovery of an unidentified parchment in his wallet is fingered by Griffin as the cause. Seems Furnace's financial prosperity is attached to a little old-fashioned witchcraft, and the runic parchment in Spiller's possession is a supernatural tracking device for a demonic assassin due to dismember Spiller before daybreak - that is, unless he can figure out exactly who slipped it to him, and can slip it back to them before the appointed hour...This novel suffers badly from excess padding and a plot-point for plot-point lift from Tourneur - but it is quite well-written and enjoyable on its own merits, all the same.

He shows absolutely no remorse and offers no apologies for exterminating the criminals who wreak havoc on society. This is a very dark novel with extremely graphic descriptions of gratuitous violence coupled with excessive profanity. However, the book is also a great yarn with intricate sub-plots and places the reader in the midst of the action that took place during the Viet Nam War era.

6,3.04,0.9917,1996,04-15,4602500,Sluggos North,Chattanooga,$,Princeton,Southeast,13,"Nominally a future-history of Martian colonization, Red Mars covers the initial 100 Martian colonists, the influx of workers as corporations attempt to exploit the planet's resources, and the consequences as conditions worsen. The book is divided into eight parts, each telling the story from the point of view of one of six characters. Each character is interesting and three dimensional. The first, Frank Chalmers, is a stunning example - a machiavellian sociopath who arranges the murder of his best friend. The book suggests early on that the characters are dysfunctional, but most are not, and Robinson describes each personality in a way that's easy to relate to. Most readers will see some of themselves in every character, and will be moved when many disappear from the story as events unfurl.Robinson's prose is easy to read and descriptive. He lovingly describes the Martian landscape, and the events that change the planet. He explains the processes and technologies being used to make the planet more habitable. Mars and its future is viewed through different cultures and ideologies. And Robinson describes political and social systems evolving, growing, and collapsing - the only challenges the colonists seem unable to solve are those that cannot be fixed technologically. The ending is dramatic and, cheesy last line notwithstanding, overwhelming.A word about the politics: Several reviewers have trouble understanding the concept of sympathetic characters not representing the author. Nobody argues that, through Chalmers, Robinson is advocating murder, so why assume that characters portrayed as idealistic hot-heads advocating an enlightened Utopia (not communism) are attempts to convert readers to Marxism? Robinson's prediction of a near future where a handful of democratically unaccountable transnational corporations wield more power than governments is neither unreasonable nor extremist propaganda nor unique; nor is it that people sick of these conditions might reject them for something Utopian, and might make up a sizable proportion of those wanting to leave Earth. Robinson is describing what might happen and why, rather than pushing a particular ideology. It is notable that the consequences of the actions of most of the first 100 are hardly positive: why would an author promote a vision of an enlightened Utopia by having for it such divided, belligerent, builders?If Red Mars has faults, they are that it is fairly humourless, and some of the science (nothing, fortunately, important to the principle of convincing the reader that colonization is possible) is somewhat stretched.There are no ray-guns or bug-eyed aliens: there is much to think about. If you're looking for an airport novel, go read L. Ron Hubbard. If you can watch CNN talking 23 hours a day about scandals effecting minor Democrats, and still grumble ""Darned liberal bias"", you may be too right-wing to cope with fictional characters disagreeing with you; go read some ""Doc"" Smith or something instead. Otherwise the reader needs patience and a willingness to get inside a whole range of radically different characters. Most of the book is interesting, but the climax is especially so.Posing more problems than answers, Red Mars leaves the reader uneasy about humanity's progress, with a mix of optimism about what we can do, and pessimism for what we are likely to do; it portrays characters the reader can feel for, and a planet to fall in love with. What a wonderful book."

What is new, though, is this book, which strays from Ryan completely, and gives readers the background of Clancy's most mysterious character. This book, in my opinion, is nothing like any of the other Clancy tales to date. It was published right in between some of Clancy's most popular books, yet has nothing to do with any of them. It takes place in the Washington/Baltimore area and Vietnam and is a great thriller. There is no technical mumbo-jumbo that is typically found in Clancy's works. It's all action of the best kind.

As it was, I put off reading it for awhile, because I somehow knew I would not like it. But surprisingly, I really liked it. Much better than the usual clap-trap that is produced as fantastic fiction these days. DWD was well written, thought provoking, and intense at times. The only problem I usually have with these books is the orgy of cruelty and brutality lavished upon the reader. Martin could use to stand back a bit from the excruciating detail involving this, but that is a minor flaw to me. As for waiting another six years to find out what happens to the characters, no big deal. There are plenty of other great books to read while waiting."

I love Martin's writing, but I have to say that this is by far the worst book he has written. Where were the editors? It's way too long and it fails to advance the story more than a millimeter. You could read the first chapter and the last chapter and skip everything in the middle, because nothing happens! Well, it does, but somehow it all seems very boring and predictable. The copy editing is sloppy with errors in grammar and overuse of the same words and phrases.This book should have been released as two books. Then the first book would have been released sooner, it would have been shorter and the publisher would make twice a much money. The fans would be happy and the author not so burned out. I hope the next book is shorter, tighter and more eventful."

7,3.26,0.9934,1985,12-13,17580300,Otarian,,USD 25.00-40.00,UAB,Midwest,7,"A lot of the reviews that have been negative so far for Dance talk about how ""the wait wasn't worth it"". But the thing is, for the most part these reviews only harp on the fact that ""oh, I've waited six years for Martin to finally finish it, but there's no epic battles/resolution/revelations"" etcetera and ""I waited so long for THIS? Oh man I'm done with the series"" blah blah blah. They don't actually talk about the story itself. And while I'm as critical of Martin for how absurdly long he makes his loyal readers wait between installments--especially since the argument could be made that a part of that wait is spent by him not spending as much time on writing as fans think he should--this isn't the place for those arguments. A book should be judged by its contents, not how long a reader waited for it.These people, while not completely unjustified in a lot of the criticisms they're raising--especially in the abundance of cliff hangers and open-ended storylines-- are missing the point of what, in my mind, makes A Song of Ice and Fire great--the characters, the unpredictable nature of where the plot's going to go, the wonderful world of Westeros and its environs, but again, most of all, the characters! Dance is much more about character development than other books in Martin's series, especially compared to Storm of Swords, in which almost every chapter involved some great action scene, or development, or advancement of the plot in some way.The pace here is more like that of Clash of Kings--and much better, not just barely better than Feast, which I think most will agree is the most slow-paced novel in the series. While it lacked epic scenes equivalent to the Battle of Blackwater, the wildlings' attack on the wall, or the Red Wedding, there's still plenty of solid content that should satiate most fans of the series, particularly the introduction of a storyline/group of characters that pretty much changes everything, and one cliffhanger for a certain character that I had to reread again, it was so exciting and unexpected.Again, its the characterization and not the war or overarching storyline that's the star of the show here. The POVs are essentially divided into three groups: those in the North and around the Wall reacting to the events of Mance Rayder's failed attack on the wall and Roose Bolton's rise to Warden of the North; Dany as she attempts to establish her role as Meereen's monarch and the various suitors and others attempting to reach her and her dragons; and a smattering of returning POVs from Feast for Crows which, while not completely resolving loose ends from the previous novel, do just enough to tie up those loose ends but leave the reader intrigued as to what happens next.The three main POVs are easily the most slowly paced, but they also have, in my mind, some of the best character development in the series. Jon is struggling to remain neutral in Stannis' efforts to win the north, while at the same time asserting himself as a strong commander. Tyrion has decided to embrace the image of the evil imp everyone else had wrongly made him out to be while trying to decide what to do with his life. And Dany makes decisions in her ruling of Meereen that may or not go against the destiny meant for her.I enjoyed the other POVs more than I did the main ones, but really, all of them, set the stage for what will hopefully be a brilliant next installment...whenever that may be. The new POVs (there are four--two are brand new characters and two are former periphery characters)are more or less welcome additions to the story, especially one of the new ones. Finally, Dance easily has the best one-shot POV (meaning prologue or epilogue) of the series so far.And the book isn't just nothing happening until the end as some are making it out to be--there is a HUGE revelation early on(not to mention another towards the end careless readers will miss), and one of the main POVs comes out of the gate really strong in a moment that had me cheering when I read it.No, it isn't perfect. But Martin can't make every installment of the series Storm of Swords or of its same exact caliber.Complaints for me include, that while cliffhangers aren't necessarily a bad thing, and some of them are excellent in this, others just left me going ""really? That's all we get?"" Martin definitely overuses his techniques of repeating phrases and describing food and fauna in a ton of detail. And while I enjoyed most of the POVs, I had a problem with two of the new ones--one only got one chapter, and the other, who was foreshadowed in the previous novel, just never became fully realized for me.But hey, at the end of the day, I got to be reunited with Jon, Dany, Tyrion, Bran, Davos, and other characters we haven't seen in years. And while there may not be a slambang, epic beheading, battle, or wedding people may have wanted as a reward for their long wait, there is still plenty of developments, and plenty of foreshadowing at things to come, that should leave most fans at least somewhat happy, or at the very least talking about and debating the events of Dance."

I've read and re-read most of his books more than twice, and all of them to date at least once. This is where John Kelly (Clark) hits the scene, and his story is world class REAL and emotional, even for ""Mission: Impossible"" fiction. There's nothing in Clancy's books that ""couldn't happen"" even when not at his best. You can read the back cover for the storyline, but I promise that once you open the front cover you won't stop until you've read everything in between.

I think Red is the best of the series, but all of them have their strengths.What I liked most is that it was fairly like life. Yeah, I know most people seem to want escapist junk, but this is SF in the tradition of Heinlein's and Asimov's earlier work - though with a unique style. He pays attention to real science and doesn't postulate something outrageous that isn't ever going to happen. He makes very real characters, and takes you skipping across the years.Maybe, like Clarke, this is something that authors can do as they get older and have more perspective.My comments are mostly with two things, one of which wasn't known when Robinson wrote Red Mars. The first is when he constantly talks about the fines, micron sized particles that get into everything and on everything.The problem with fines like that is that they have a well documented respiratory effect. They cause diseases like ""black lung"" and ""silicovolcanoconiosis"" or ""tin miner's disease"" or ""asbestosis"". So this is an inconsistency in the story, because fines that small get into the alveoli, get attacked by white blood cells, kill the white blood cells and the result is scarring and death. Based on the descriptions in the Red Mars book, the fines would have killed everyone within 10 years or so.The second problem is one Robinson didn't know about, that is still uncertain. Chromium has been detected on Mars' surface in surprising quantities. So it's part of the dust. The problem with that is that if, as is quite likely, much of it is in the hexavalent form of Chromium, it will cause tumors in mammals very rapidly. Since the Mars settlers are described as living in a virtual bath of fines, they would probably get large amounts of hexavalent chromium into their water, absorb it through their mouth and saliva swallowing and things like that. The average time for them to develop tumors would be around 4 years, for many within 1 year. (This is the stuff that the movie ""Erin Brokavich"" was based on.)So those details kept bothering me. Until a water cycle gets going to wash the fines out, settle them into soil and dissolve the chromium so it can react, I don't think the story as it is told could possibly happen. The settlers would have to live hermetically sealed, or much better so. Maybe genetically engineered people could handle it."

I have read all these books together in the past month or so and this was the first book that I actually skimmed through a few chapters. I know Feast for Crows got really mixed reviews but I still highly enjoyed it anyway. But this book actually has a chapter that we've already read from Crows in here but it's Jon's point of view not Sam's. I thought that was a real waste of space. And I don't care for Vitarion and I thought there was useless time spent on the Dornish men here. I've read that Crows and Dragons was originally one book but GRRM broke it up into two planing that Dragons would come out within the year of Crows and it never happened that way because GRRM decided to rewrite Dragons. My feeling is he probably shouldn't have done that. Oh well. There is usually a dud in every batch. Hopefully the next book does not take any where near as long to come out. I still can't wait to read it.
6,3.22,0.99365,1989,09-07,3880300,Great Cookie,Towson,,Princeton,East,16,"As the cover blurb on the 1993 edition, by Arthur C. Clarke, has it: ""It should be required reading for the colonists of the next century."" Well here we are in that century and polls show and pols say there's not enough interest in going to Mars to bother.The novel is still worth the trip. It's light on the tech and sci and heavy on the human relationships among the First Hundred colonists of Americans and Russians. Their one-way vehicle to Mars in 2026 (still time for that) was nicely practical: a cluster of rotating toruses made of interconnected fuel tanks from shuttle stacks taken into orbit (rather than discarded over the ocean) by both the American shuttle (retiring next year) and the old Soviet one (which only flew a few times).So that's impossible, but the story still makes day-to-day life on Mars imaginable. It makes me want to put on my ""walker"" and helmet and go for a lope in the low g, guided by a personal AI on my wrist, even if the Internet is still confined to pre-Web bulletin boards. When Robinson does describe the tech he does it well. A favorite is the building and use of a space elevator between Pavonis Mons and a captured asteroid. Thirty-story elevator cars make the journey up and down in five days. Once out of the Mars gravity well, it's much simpler (and cheaper) to board a rocket for earth, or arrive on one and take an elevator down to the planet.All in all, a believable and, at times, fun read. No wonder it still sells well."

7,3.07,0.9904,1988,10-04,1220400,New York Pizzeria,Houston,,Florida St,West,12,"There are so many things to rave about when it comes to Sara Gruen's novel.First it's a period piece (which I love) set in Depression-Era America that gets all of the details just right: it's gritty, truthful, and unsentimental, yet still fascinating and entertaining. I was amazed and enlightened by all of the details of an early-20th century circus and all of its inner workings.Secondly, the novel is told from two different perspectives. One is a 23-year-old Jacob Jankowski, who is an ivy-leage educated animal doc and recently ""orphaned"", while the other perspective is a 90(or 93)-year-old Jacob, whose days are spent in a nursing home, longing for the days of his youth. Both perspectives are equally compelling and entertaining, and they come together to reveal mysteries about the story in the end.Speaking of mysteries, I loved that there was a twist that totally caught me off guard in the end. These always make for great pleasures if done right, and Gruen's surprise delivers a punch at the end that I wasn't even looking for.I already am waiting for the mention of film rights to this one. It screams movie all the way through. Not just because of the amazing story and characters, but also for the potentially incredible set design, costume design, and stunning visuals. The elderly Jacob would be a great role for someone in the winter of their years and the flashbacks between then and now just yearns to be filmed.Finally, the characters in this book sold me. Every one of them is a real treat. As you might imagine, the characters in a circus are, well, real characters, and those from The Benzini Brothers circus is no exception. Jacob, upon accidentally joining this troupe, discovers real evil, unlikely friendships, and the love of his life. The characters are not exaggerations or caricatures like another unnamed circus novel I have read. These people are empathetic, realistic, funny, and fascinating creations you won't soon forget.Get a copy of this novcl today. You'll be rooting for Jacob Jankowski all the way."

This isn't art folks. If you think it is I am here to tell you that you have been duped. Yeah, Robert Jordan could have been the new Tolkien. Instead he died with people thinking he was a shill. The same is going to be said here like it or not.Martin has lost the ability to write a decent story over the two decades I guess it takes to complete what, more than likely in the author's original plans, was a proper 3 or 4 book series in total. DoD is nothing more than a plodding mid-tier adventure that leaves more loose ends than it solves. Sound familiar?I bet WoT could have made a 10 book series if Jordan was an actual artist with conviction. I'm tempted to say WoT had the best original plans, a midway point between Tolkien and Martin, but RJ really flew the coop. Martin hasn't quite arrived in nutterville but he might as well be a couple minutes from town at this point.This is what happens, folks: your original, and more than probably excellent, plan for the trilogy (LOL) is force fed a bunch of 'corporate corn' for weeks. Hell, years even.... and then the trilogy simply can't cover the world building and character killing. Well, oh well right? OH NO. Now we are writing seriously and seriousness demands thousands of pages that don't have any connection to the original story but to prolong it. And then the side stories become part of the main story. And then.... barf.The printers start printing money....My advice is: don't ever get into these 'novels'. Ever. They are just another crack addiction that goes awry. I honestly don't even care that I have never finished this or the Wheel of Time. I probably will not ever pick them up again. That is exactly how much these authors have erased my memory of the good times I used to have with them. Horrible.I am also here to tell exactly how these writers function. They are not great writers, for they fear the ending of their 'baby'. Great writers continue on through their best work and keep doing other things, they keep innovating on their own style or they stop writing. Well, he may have stopped writing for a bit I don't really know, but what I do know is that Martin is now in full on 'Soap Opera' mode just like Jordan turned to around book 6 of WoT. This means he is simply wanking away whatever comes to mind at this point while following a loose structure. And while Jordan's work got him through book 6, some say to book 9, before people started to question what was going on, Martin has the detractors firmly in tow after Book 4. That isn't a good sign.And I HIGHLY doubt Martin keeps as much information about storylines as Jordan did.... meaning this will be an even bigger mess than WoT unless they can get a really good editor in here. For those that do enjoy this stuff great. No problem have a good time. But after being burned by WoT MAJORLY, I don't step into these time sinks lightly. And this one has way too many parallels to WoT. Not only that, he is running out of decent characters to kill and his world building is still second tier behind Jordan and Tolkien. I like his dialogue more often than not but I cannot support these guys who just don't have the vision required to complete their sagas in a proper timeframe WITHOUT all the egregious fat and gristle."

The story is told by the main character in his nineties who is in a nursing home, looking back on his life and how he got to where he is. The prologue is of the climactic event in his life in the circus, and then the rest of the book alternates every few chapters between his first hand accounts in the present in the nursing home and his first hand accounts in the past as a youth in the circus. The scenes from the present in the nursing home force you to sympathize with a man whose body is old but who is mind is young and the struggles associated with such a circumstance, while the scenes from the past in the circus are a window into the past that show you who this man used to be.This book had a captivating beginning, and satisfying ending, but my only problem, and the singular reason I didn't give it five stars was that in the middle, the story was just a tad slow. However, don't let that discourage you from reading it because, as you can see from my title, that only warranted a half-star reduction from me because this really is a great read as a whole whether you love or hate the circus and I recommend it full-heartedly to lovers of a good story.PS: For a novel with a completely different plot, but with similar execution (telling the story by alternating between present and past) and a fantastic five-star story, try Setterfield's The Thirteenth Tale."

He's contemplative and slow-to-act, the opposite of the explosives he is in charge of detonating.We meet up with Jordan once he is tasked to blow up a bridge, a bridge that is pivotal to the war effort. He goes into the mountains to meet with a band of rebels who are to help him destroy the bridge and attack the base on the other side of the bridge. Jordan meets and falls in love with a young Spanish woman Maria and the story reaches it's climax when he is forced to make a tough decision and blow the bridge without the proper equipment.Like many of Hemingway's novels, For Whom the Bell Tolls was quite wordy. There was a lot of talk and not a lot of action. Honestly, I preferred Hemingway's The Old Man and the Sea and A Farewell to Arms. The novel was interesting.

At a higher level, it is about connections between people: indeed, the book opens with the following quotation from John Donne:. . . any mans death diminishes me, because I am involved in Mankinde; And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee.Hemingway takes us inside a guerilla band during the Spanish Civil War, mostly through the eyes of Robert Jordan, an American professor-cum-demolitions expert. Jordan is a Communist - at least he is strongly drawn to Communism - who has come to Spain to fight fascism. He has character and a sense of duty. Since, from our vantage point, at the beginning of the 21st century, it seems that not many people do, this gives the book a kind of ""long ago and far away"" feel. Readers in 1940, when the book was published, no doubt experienced it in a more immediate way.This book includes many memorable secondary characters: among them Pilar, the wise leader of the band of partisans, Pablo, her drunken, amoral, but capable husband, and Maria, the love interest in the story.Like every Hemingway novel that I've read, this one is well written. Hemingway uses the archaic English ""thou"" for the Spanish ""tu"" and translates literally from Spanish to English to better convey an impression of Spanish dialogue to English readers. These devices are initially distracting but are actually very successful at taking the reader inside the minds of the Spanish-speaking characters in this book.This is a distinguished work and an exciting one. It deserves its acclaim."

5,3.61,0.99581,2003,01-29,6992300,,Fredericksburg,,Troy,South,14,"I hesitate to slap a derisive label like ""chick lit"" on anything, but author Sara Gruen's third novel is a prime example of the worst kind of ""women's fiction""; Water for Elephants was obviously written by a woman solely for other women, with no attempt to be realistic from the male point of view. Instead it perpetuates the romantic ideals set forth by Harlequin and its ilk -- heights that no three-dimensional male can ever reach. (No wonder it was a word-of-mouth bestseller.)This is shown most strikingly through Gruen's protagonist, Jacob Jankowski. He does not talk, think, or act like any (straight) man I have ever met. The purpose he serves, it seems, is to stand in for a lot of women's idea of what a man should be. When a man looks at another man and calls him ""unshaven"" with the implication that what he really means is ""unclean,"" you know you're nowhere near reality. This type of man lives only in fiction.Gruen even makes Jacob a virgin (though old enough to have a degree from veterinary school) so that when he and the female lead finally make it to the bed (which is inevitable in this world), it more closely match the unspoken wishes of her audience.(Now, understand, men's fiction is no better from the woman's point of view, with the hero more often than not bedding the female lead, who then conveniently dies so he can have access to a series of new women without guilt for the expense of a succession of prostitutes. I'm not saying it's any better, but at least it's marketed to men and not a general audience.)Gruen relies so much on stereotypes from romance novels (or even just their covers) and ""chick flicks"" that none of the characters in Water for Elephants ever feels like a real human being but simply an archetype playing its part in her story. The writing flows nicely, and the story is somewhat interesting if you don't mind melodrama.Also, Gruen manages to humanize people who have previously been seen as freaks, but this was all for nought when I never believed that the narrator was telling me the truth about his gender. I actually kept waiting for that to be a ""twist"" in the story, and in fact was disappointed when it never came.Plus, if a man were really telling the story, he would undoubtedly have recognized the sophomoric unintentional hilarity in the following passage: Teams of men are ... raising enormous poles.... I pass a group of ten throwing their combined weight against a single rope as a man off to the side chants, ""Pull it, shake it, break it! Again--pull it, shake it, break it! Now downstake it!""

The abuse of anticlimax began to drive me nuts, I felt like reading Ann Rice's Queen Of The Damned all over again. Still, I always enjoy his style, as all his books, you can find pretty pearls of writing worth of quoting here and there. My first impression after finishing this book was that, with the imminent broadcast of HBO's GOT miniseries, the publishing house put pressure on Martin to wrap whatever he had, try to get something that would work as an end, and hand it over for it's quick publishing, and that is what happened. I read he at least took out 4 already written chapters to save for The Winds Of Winter. So this book should be seen as a bridge, where action just was build up to reach it's climax... only that... we'll probably will have to wait another 6 years! Let us hope not!"

Set during the Spanish Civil War of the 1930s, this novel explores war as it really is, not as what it is glorified or vilified to be according to the whims of a journalist or novelist. There is very little of the actual war in the foreground of the plot--the entire novel spans only about four days--but the relationships of the characters and their interaction with one another allows the reader to see what war is like from the viewpoint of those who participate in it. Like Crane's The Red Badge of Courage, this book deals with the psychological and human ramifications of war.The hero is Robert Jordan, an American idealist fighting in Spain on the side of the `Republic,' or Communist, party. Opposite the `Reds' are the so-called fascists. At the beginning, Jordan has an unflinching and unwavering duty to the cause, but the people he meets and a girl he falls in love with alter somewhat his outlook. The bulk of the novel deals with Jordan's own philosophy, but also with the philosophy of the band of guerillas he is assigned to complete a mission with. Through his love for the girl, Maria, and his interaction with the scheming rebel leader Pablo and his wife Pilar, Jordan learns much about life and war.The plot moves quickly enough, and all leads up to the final climactic battle at the bridge. This is perhaps Hemingway's finest moment, and his treatment of the battle and fate of the group is nothing short of masterful. The quote from John Donne ""never send to know for whom the bell tolls"" looms ominously throughout the novel, and the battle of the bridge and the final, chilling moment of truth for Robert Jordan drives home the harrowing fact that is the reality of war: ""it tolls for thee."""

But this is the beginning of 1849, gold has been discovered in California, and Susie is convinced she can make an even greater fortune by transporting her girls and her furniture to the Far West. Flashman ends up marrying her (bigamously, of course) and becomes the titular boss of her wagon train out of Independence, Missouri, bound for Sacramento. Actually, having met mountain men and famous frontier scouts and crossed paths with several sorts of Indians, they only make it as far as Santa Fe, which Susie decides is far enough. And Flashman is on his own again -- and to get the cash to continue his long-term escape, he commits an act that is remarkably callous and brutal even for Flashy. But he doesn't get far, being captured this time by Apaches and getting himself married for the third time. It's a good thing he has such a talent for languages! But he eventually accompanies Kit Carson to Wyoming and thence home.Then we jump to the second half of this story, a quarter-century later. One of the more delightful continuing themes throughout this series is Flashman's peculiar relationship with his wife, Elspeth -- gorgeous, brainless, devoted to her Gallant Sir Harry, and yet as completely unprincipled and lecherous as her husband when it comes to sex. In the early days, he couldn't say anything about it because she controlled the purse-strings. Now, in middle age, they've long since reached an accommodation. Besides, Harry has never actually caught her in flagrante. Anyway, Elspeth's craving for travel is the reason Flashman is back in America in 1876 to begin with, and at first he's outraged to discover that she's probably been off rolling in the hay with the great Lacotah chief (and his old acquaintance) Spotted Tail. But then he thinks, as always, ""if I'm wrong and she's as chaste as the mountain dew, so much the better. If she's not, what's an Indian more or less?"" Because Flashman has been recruited to take part in the U.S. Government's unenthusiastic negotiations with the Plains tribes in the wake of another gold strike, this time in the Black Hills, and Elspeth is along for the ride. And then his lecherous nature leads him to lend his name to a land development scheme in North Dakota -- and that will be his undoing, as Fate and Justice come back to bite him good and hard. The upshot is that Sir Harry is bound hand and foot in a Sioux tipi on the Little Big Horn when Custer and the 7th Cavalry show up.I've never been a Custer fan. As Flashman notes, he was quite a good cavalry brigade commander during the Civil War (when he also didn't have the leeway for independent action) -- but he was a terrible army officer, which is a somewhat different thing. And by the mid-1870s, his political ambitions were driving his self-aggrandizement to a point of such reckless disregard for reality that he had become a positive danger to those in his command. In fact, Flashman makes a number of comparisons between the Sioux campaign and the Crimea, regarding the lack of intelligence (in the military sense), the personal arrogance of those in command, and the sheer stupidity of not knowing when to quit. Plus, Gen. Terry was a nice man with not nearly the bloody-mindedness of Lord Lucan or Colin Campbell. Plus, face it, Custer was an idiot, so there. In any case, Flashman survives the massacre, as you knew he would, but he does so with the timely assistance of the very last person he could have predicted. And that leads to a rather sad ending.This is, I think, one of the best of the entire series (though I wasn't crazy about _Flash for Freedom!_). But that may just be me. I generally have to take the author's word for what the British Raj was like, but the Old Southwest before the Civil War is a time and a place in which I have taken a very close interest for a number of decades, both academically and personally. I've been to most of the places Flashman visits, I've read every one of the books he cites as sources in his footnotes, and I know a good deal about most of the major historical characters he meets, and I have to say Fraser has done a splendid job of it. He genuinely makes the New Mexico desert, especially, come alive. I agree that it's a beautiful and frightening place, depending on the circumstances. A terrific yarn. But I have to say it's a shame that the author died before he got around to writing of Flashman's adventures on both sides of the American Civil War."

This book was different, it had my rapt attention from start to finish - though the end was disappointing to me. After chapters of such a great story, I found the almost ridiculous improbability of the ending to be quite out of place. I also could have happily lived without the animal abuse and the unnecessary deaths of Walter & Camel, but the ending sat particularly poorly with me. In addition, the final chapter seemed to bring the previously well paced story to a very abrupt halt that felt all wrong. I enjoyed the rest of the book, however, and feel it's well worth the read."

(I thought that Sum of All Fears was pushing it.) But Without Remorse is quite another story. Here Clancy reveals himself to be a real facist. Certainly the victims of Kelly/Clark's rage are not innocents, but they are pointless executed, and the book doesn't even take the time to explore the effect that this has on Clark or really give him any kind of depth. In Lethal Weapon, we only know that Riggs's wife is dead, this alone is enough to make him suicidal and add considerable depth to his character. In Without Remorse, the love interest's death is only exploited to give Clark an excuse to kill everyone. I found Clancy's obvious animus towards liberals and women distasteful and his lack of respect for human life and even a sense of the impact that taking another person's life has on your own--well, it is truely baffling to consider how a man who is marginally an intellectual can be that primative.

Jacob Jankowski is about to finish up his veterinary degree at Cornell University when he learns that his parents have been killed in a car crash. Stunned by this awful and sudden turn of events, Jacob completely blanks while taking his final exams. He walks out and wanders out of town in a complete daze, eventually jumping a train. It turns out he has jumped the circus train for the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth.Jacob pretty much instantly falls for Marlena, one of the star performers. The only problem is that she is already married to August, the animal manager, who is, as we come to find out, a paranoid schizophrenic with erratic behavior problems. The story focuses on these three characters as the circus train makes its way around the country, performing in various cities. Along the way, the circus acquires an elephant, Jacob befriends his reluctant roommate, and tries to save an ailing friend from being tossed from the circus.This is a really interesting and moving book. It's really fascinating to read about daily circus life and how things worked. And it's a touching story about a smart elephant, a compassionate vet, and a forbidden love. I do wish there had been some more charater development for Rosie the elephant, though. Also, the story is told in retrospect, from a present-day Jacob who is now in his 90s. Every few chapters, the story skips back to present day, and the nursing home-bound narrator. I felt the story would have worked a lot better if it had just stuck to the circus part of the story. The present day interjections were distracting. Other than that, this was an excellent book. Highly recommended."

5,3.51,0.9998,1985,08-07,5168900,Thai Satay Restaurant Bar,S San Francisco,$$,Auburn,Southeast,11,"The ur-text for today's wartime adventure novel, ""For Whom The Bell Tolls"" remains a standard bearer for pulse-pounding action fiction, and one of the true masterpieces by the most celebrated American author of his time.Robert Jordan is a Spanish-language instructor from Montana who, now in Spain, has a job of another kind: blow up a critical bridge under enemy control before his comrades, the Republicans of the Spanish Civil War, mount a critical attack. He falls in with a band of motley guerrillas, discovering the joy and passion of life even as he must make peace with the real possibility of his death.When published in 1940, there was little need to explain the title: the bell was tolling pretty loudly for just about everyone outside of Sweden and Chile as the Axis powers led by Nazi Germany rolled up giant chunks of the globe. Germany's three-year dress rehearsal had been the Spanish Civil War, where they helped Spanish fascists and monarchists overthrow the Marxist-led Republicans while Western democracies watched idly. Ernest Hemingway, a strong supporter of the Republican cause, lost arguably the only country he ever really loved.""For Whom The Bell Tolls"" could have been an exercise in told-you-so or score settling with the right-wing victors Hemingway despised. Yet the story is so engaging - so raw and sweeping in its style, so visceral in form, and undogmatic in outlook - that it is hard to know from reading it just how bruised a champion Hemingway had been for the losing team. The most drawn-out, brutal section of narrative deals with atrocities committed by Republicans, not fascists. Rebels and Republicans alike appear oddly human.""Do you think you have a right to kill any one? No. But I have to. How many of those you have killed have been real fascists? Very few. But they are all the enemy to whose force we are the opposing force. But you like the people of Navarra better than those of any other part of Spain. Yes. And you kill them. Yes.""That's one of many internal monologues Jordan has with himself in the course of the book, which may annoy some expecting more wall-to-wall action but works fine by me. It's easy imagining oneself pondering similar questions in similar situations, and the running stream-of-consciousness adds to the nail-biting tension.Hemingway also does very well by the secondary characters, especially the guerrilla band Jordan takes up with. Their leader, Pablo, was a once-ruthless killer of fascists now reduced to drink and train-robbing. ""There is not enough of you left to make a sick kitten,"" says Pablo's bitter woman, Pilar, herself a tigress and Jordan's chief ally. Pilar is both supporter and scoffer of Jordan's budding relationship with Maria, a teenaged rape survivor rescued by the guerrillas. This is not a merry band of outlaws; their very fractiousness draws you in.As a Sam Peckinpah fan, I was struck by how pleasingly similar ""For Whom The Bell Tolls"" was to the classic Western desperado saga ""The Wild Bunch"". Both are straightforward action yarns with a lot of backstory, vivid characters and setting, and a storyline that cleverly pulls you in even as it seems to ramble.""For Whom The Bell Tolls"" is less concerned about the bridge itself (where or when precisely this action is occurring is never spelled out) then the feelings that surround warfare, and how and why one man must do what he can, for as Rick said in ""Casablanca"", the problems of one man don't add up to a hill of beans in this crazy mixed-up world. Hemingway's ending is less Hollywood but just as stirring, and a fittingly open-ended climax to this singular story."

It was so well written, goes seamlessly between the past and the present. The love story (was it between he and Marlena or he and Rosie?) was lyrically written. The author did an amazing job of pulling me back and forth between the two. I even shed a few tears over a few different things. I'm not an animal activist, but certain parts of this book made me very uncomfortable. The history of the circus is pretty well known. We know the animals were mistreated (heck, they are today too), but the author writes so well about this subject that I found it hard to swallow that lump in my throat. It's obvious she did some major research into the subject matter.When I originally read the description for this book, it was on my ""skip it"" list, but a few of my friends read it and told me I ""had"" to read it. I'm so glad they did. This was a beautiful book and definitely in my top 10 for the year.=======================February 2010:I read this one just six months ago but someone in my book club chose it so I decided to re-read it. It's always interesting when I read a book a second time, especially if it was one that I really enjoyed (and this was definitely a book I enjoyed immensely.I noticed things I didn't notice in the first read, probably because I knew what was going to happen so I found a lot of the little quirky foreshadowing and things. The prologue, of course, caught me and a lot of ""ahhh..."" moments.This is a book you must read. It really is that simple. I had looked at it a few times, but it really didn't look like anything I would want to read, so I kept skipping it. A friend of mine insisted I read it last year and I'm glad she did.

This is one of those books I knew Clancy needed to write, and hopefully he writes more, because Clark is fantastic character.Clearly the war on drugs has been lost at virtually every juncture. Traditional law enforcement is akin to giving everybody a can of Lysol and expecting the common cold to be cured. Yeah, you may get the obvious stuff, but there's so much out there, you're sure to miss enough to keep the supply of bacteria flowing.While I'm not a proponent of vigilantism, few people in this country have not been touched in some way by the pushers, cookers and dealers. They aren't just on the street corners in the bad neighborhoods, either. They inhabit every socioeconomic strata, including the gated communities inhabited by the most affluent.There are times where the viruses on humanity need to be cut out like the cancer they are, and a character like Clark can do it. Can you imagine a drug trade in a community where the dealers are shot without warning, upon getting caught dealing by a phantom hero? Or worse, are found naked and dying on the street after some torture in a hyperbaric chamber? I can. The drug trade simply wouldn't exist.Violence should be a last resort at an conflict resolution, but when all other methods fail, then the application of violence should be undertaken -- Without Remorse."

6,3.18,0.99378,2015,04-17,9663500,Ritual Café,Des Moines,USD 0.00-25.00,Georgia,East,10,"Hemingway published FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS in 1940, just after the end of the Spanish Civil War. Surely, one of Hem's goals in writing this novel was to capture in fiction the full human and political complexity of this war, which was, for a time, the great international cause. This may explain why this novel, despite its great craftsmanship and virtuosity, reads a little long. Hem, you see, had to get everything in.IMHO, the best feature of this terrific book is its wonderful Spanish characters. These participate in the war, which is a great cause for Robert Jordan, the novel's protagonist. But they participate because of family loyalty, fascist war crimes, or class rage and soldiering is mostly peripheral to their personalities. What the reader remembers is not their support of the Republic but the integrity of Anselmo, the dignity of Fernando, the humor of Agustin, the simple loving sincerity of Maria, the harsh surface of Pilar, and the murderous treachery of Pablo. These are, basically, ordinary Spaniards caught in a gruesome tragedy, not ideologues or idealists who are transformed or energized by the cause.Hem also handles Robert Jordan skillfully. When Jordan first appears, he seems to be concerned only with his duty to the cause, which, on this mission, is to blow up a bridge. But quickly, Jordan meets the loving Maria. Then, through this relationship, Hem explores Jordan's thoughts and feelings on life and death. While Jordan is not an extraordinary man with breakthrough thoughts, he is an extraordinary character who, thanks to Maria, both examines the rationale for risking his life and identifies the beauty of what may be its final few days.There are many great scenes in this novel. Among my favorites are the appearance of the planes and Pilar, at fireside, telling the story of her matador lover. And--surprise!--Hemingway is funny in FWTBT, not in a hilarious Robin Williams style, but with the dexterity of a witty companion. With Hemingway's misogyny, competitiveness, alcoholism, and depression now raised to critical prominence, I was surprised to see that the man could be a good guy.FWTBT is number 74 on the Modern Library's list of 100 Best Novels... a bit low in my estimation."
5,3.07,0.9938,1990,10-17,7605000,Marco's Pizza,Lansing,,Kansas St,Midwest,11,"It's clear why this unusual work wound up on the NY Times Bestseller List, because it will appeal to a mass audience. It captures a time and environment that stirs the curiosity of young and old. Who wouldn't be interested in exploring the dysfunctional dynamics of the circus family, during the perilous era of the early 30's. It allows you to finally be able to, run away to the circus, in the comfort and safety of your easy chair. And, as intriguing as some scenes might be, it makes you just as glad you never did.While written simplistically, the messages run deep. The cruelty that existed during those hard times and the effect on man and beast, were heartbreaking. It was particularly difficult to envision the animal abuse and neglect, but it was so integral to the story that you had no choice. It was a reminder, that left unchecked and unsupervised, that the weakest amongst us will frequently be delegated the scapegoats. It was also a reminder of the evil that can be unleashed by man when faced with desperate times.Visiting the Senior Jankowski was particularly delightful. A mere ""90, or maybe 93,"" as he frequently chimed, his struggle to retain dignity and independence was inspirational and beautifully drawn out. Gruen also did a great job moving seamlessly between the Senior Jankowski and his youthful, 23 year old counterpart. Sometimes I wouldn't even notice, even though decades separated the characters, when we'd moved from one to the other, which is not easily accomplished. They were both struggling with the angst of the past, the ugliness of the moment and the uncertainty of moving forward.I've read reviews where some took exception to using Schizophrenia as an excuse for one of the characters cruelty and explosive episodes, as his behaviors were not typical for Schizophrenia. And, they definitely weren't! However, in the 30's Schizophrenia was not well understood and likely frequently misdiagnosed, becoming a catch-all for describing many signs of mental illness. I don't believe this should detract from the story.My grievances are few, but I did have some issues with the ending, which I found unrealistic, although I'm not sure we were intended to interpret the ending so concretely. If you take it beyond face value, the ending can have some very deep meaning. I think it depends entirely on the reader to decide for themselves."

That's my general rule after all. And I was sorely disappointed.In this historical novel, Jacob Jankowski, the protagonist, has left Vetrinary school at Cornell after suffering the loss of his parents, who have died in a tragic car accident. He learns fairly quickly that his father, also a vet, was heavily in debt and actually died owing money. So Jacob leaves school and his home and literally joins the circus. He travels cross country with the circus, acting as the show's vetrinarian and working under August, the head trainer and Uncle Al, the show's ringleader. August is an interesting man, alternately charming and brutal. He's also married to the beautiful Marlena, a performer, that Jacob forms a special bond with. This novel is about Jacob's relationship with Marlena, with the new elephant, Rosie and with Uncle Al.There are definitely several themes that are prevalent in this novel, which are super easy to pick out. Water is for cleansing, for instance and the train tracks are for choosing a life path.I was not impressed by this book at all. The themes were easy to spot and the ending was just as easy to spot. The characters were shallow and one dimensional and I found myself annoyed with them more often than I was intrigued by them. I just didn't really like it - I kept expecting it to get better and it didn't. It was a complete and utter failure."
7,3.17,0.99246,1999,01-25,4173500,Vegetarian,Minneapolis,,Gonzaga,West,10,"For this installment of the Aubrey/Maturin series, author Patrick O'Brian went to a little-known historical skirmish that took place between Great Britain and France (as usual!) over the ownership of a couple islands in the Indian Ocean, including Mauritius. As O'Brian points out in the introduction to the book, there was little need to embellish (i.e. fictionalize) the events, since this was such a little-known event and because there was plenty of drama to be had in what really happened (basically, the real-life commodore is changed to Jack Aubrey).The book contains all the details we come to expect from an Aubrey/Maturin novel - as appreciaton of the tactical and strategic situations, the politics of the Royal Navy, the way seniority and authority are handled, descriptions of ships, etc. But like with any well-crafted prose, such expository details never feel like exposition, but serve to immerse the reader in the world of the Napoleonic-era Royal Navy. And its never at the expense of the action or the advance of plot points. As for the novel itself, it's just as interesting and engrossing as the previous three novels in the series thus far. The resolution may not be as satisfying in the traditional sense, but historically is a happy ending indeed - carrying the dispatches after a victory may not sound like a big deal, but the captains of such ships were often feted as much or more than the actual captain that won the battle (in this case they are the same person at least). At any rate, the adherence to the overall historical timeline gives the novel a greater authenticity, even if it isn't quite the most satisfying way to script an adventure novel.There's really little else to say - if you've read any of the novels in this series you'll know what to expect. That's not to say that they are getting boring or repetative! They are each fresh and exciting in their own right, and I'll continue through the series looking forward to each new adventure.

6,3.23,0.99604,2010,03-03,10345500,Earth Fare,Chattanooga,,Tennessee,Midwest,6,"Deep, deep breath. I have been among the legion of fans who have had to sit the entire wait of YEARS for this book. I got A Feast for Crows on day one, and on day one many years later came A Dance With Dragons. I really, really didn't want to read it. Bare with me, a review is coming, but to understand the hate and vitriol in the other interviews this explanation is necessary. Before AFfC, Martin's brilliant novels were running on fewer, tighter plotlines, and a major revelation awaited in each one. Often more than one major revelation actually. Then AFfC came out, and despite being warned, we all cried foul to see that many of our favorite characters simply weren't involved. So there we were, having finished a book that seemed to have shorted us a bit, with a promise of the next book to be delivered after a short wait. Six years later we get what is essentially AFfC part 2, with an addendum containing the beginning of the next book.We started this leg of the journey very angry with AFfC, and over the years, and delays, we became more angry. We began to lose hope that the series would finish at all. And if nothing else, that sort of passion and hopelessness should let you know just how amazing this series is at connecting directly into you. Expectations were high. Just four months shy of six years after AFfC it's here: A Dance with Dragons. And that six years is the problem...A Dance with Dragons brings back the missing characters from AFfC, and as it begins there is nothing to complain about. Taken as a whole the book is clearly the middle of the road between acts two and three of the story entire. Having that in mind I think you'll enjoy it very much. Especially if you are a true fan of the series. So those of you who are, and who may be thinking about not buying (you know you will eventually), go ahead and buy it. It's Martin. It's his writing, it's his characters, and it's the same world you fell in love with over the rest of the four books. Stories as long as this have parts that may not seem to do much, but that's because the major consequences of the things that happen in A Dance wont be fully known until the start of the NEXT book. Dance is the literary equivalent of the story slowing down to stretch it's legs for the sprint. But it being written by Martin, as long as you keep that in mind, you can take a longer view and realize exactly what it is he's setting up. And what he's setting up is a MASSIVE shake-up in nearly every political, religious, and even supernatural facet of the world he's made. He's laying the path for events that will change things to such an extent that I think it may turn out to be unprecedented in fantasy literature.Let that sink in for a bit.A Dance With Dragons features less epic style action, and more personal, small conflicts. It takes the characters away from what they know, and it puts them in the thick of places they might not even belong. It's a growing experience for each and every character in the book. The problem is that these new paths are not the end of old paths.You see we as fans have wanted conclusions to some very major story points, we collectively assumed that Martin wouldn't be expanding his story any further, only staying with what he'd begun and starting to wrap it up. He didn't do that. So all of us who were reading with baited breath to find out, for instance, about Jon's parents were left in the dark. We end a Jon chapter and find that a new character is being introduced, and it seemingly has nothing at all to do with what was hinted at before. This makes us angry.But take a deep breath. The reason we were all here in the first place is precisely because of Martin's writing. This man, undoubtedly, knows what he's doing. He's 5 of 7 into what I think is going to be recognized as possibly THE fantasy series for mature audiences. We should not be angry that he didn't write what WE would have written. It's not our story to finish. It's his. And you can even take it a bit further. Re-read the first books and you'll notice how many small hints are dropped about Valyria, then come back to Dance to find that there is now a journey TO Valyria. I believe he's trying to tie up more than just the stories of the great houses we've been following. I think he's trying to tie up the bulk of his entire mythos by the end. And read more. Notice that until Dance with Dragons we had no idea that there would be a SINGLE commander of the white walkers and the things beyond the wall (and that it may be the very one who is training Bran). We didn't know the people of the forests were alive.No, I think Martin is right on track. I think he's doing brilliantly. I think I'm more than happy to give my patience and trust in him not leaving us in a lurch.A Song of Ice and Fire will have an ending. Please just take a deep breath and realize how stupid it would have been of him to start tying off all those incredible loose ends with two more books to go. Westeros just took a deep breath (and I took one with it), the next book will be the beginning of the plunge, and the last will be the plunge itself.But this book. This one stands as a worthy addition to the story. It didn't go precisely where all of us wanted, in fact it spent a lot of time in a place that was as unpleasant for us as it was for a few of the characters in it. But there is a real sense of the slow beginnings of inertia near the end. When even more characters start popping in and when the dual storylines running parallel in AFfC and ADwD finally do end... you can feel it start to move. By the end I was left feeling that all of that spreading out of story and plotlines and character arcs was about to start converging. Dance, along with Feast, are very singular events in publishing. They only came about because we, the fans, demanded Martin not skip forward several years. We wanted to know what happened. And he gave it to us. The last two books were those written precisely so that we wouldn't feel cheated. Martin cared so much about fan outcry that he wrote two extra books. I for one am greatful. The more I read from him about this world the better.For five books now we've said it along with all the Starks: ""Winter is Coming."" By the end of this book... winter is here. And NOW the fun begins. Just don't take another decade to finish this George. Please."

The earlier major players are now largely dead, but their children and heirs battle on. In the north, Jon Snow is now commander of the black watch along the wall. In the trading cities of the south, Daenerys rules over theformer slave city of Meereen--and the natives are restive. Although she speaks of seizing her native kingdom, Daenerys knows that the slavers would return if she leaves, and cannot abandon her adoptive children. So, the world beats a path to Daenerys as every second son, exile, and wanna-be power on the outs makes the voyage to the woman who mothered dragons, and who has a claim to be rightful ruler of the seven kingdoms.George R. R. Martin's epic series A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE was eye-opening and genre-stretching. I remember reading A GAME OF THRONES practically breathless. Every plot twist (and boy did the plot twist) caught me by surprise. Every character I grew to love seemed set up to fail. Martin's strong writing continues, and he has the knack of writing characters complex enough that we care about them, seeing each one as hero of his (or her) own story. Even Queen Cersei--an adulterer, incest participant, and murderer, becomes sympathetic. Here, though, in the fifth book in the series, the characters seem smaller and more focussed on every-day details.Again, I think Martin does fantasy a favor by adding not only the blood and dirt, but also the reality of war and occupation. Victory is not a matter of marching armies through town in a parade, it's sullen opposition, sneak attacks, and worrying whether your allies have betrayed you (or if your dragons have been eating your peoples' children). Managing a rag-tag force on the distant border isn't all about battling giants, it's watching larders empty and worrying about starvation. That being said, we get a LOT of that kind of detail in a book that stretches for 959 pages (not including the lists of characters).One of the key dangers in writing series is that authors find the need to move characters from point to point. That, to a large extent, is what is happening in A DANCE WITH DRAGONS. Tyrion is traveling to meet Daenerys--but doesn't quite get there. Stannis Baratheon is traveling toward Winterfell--but doesn't quite get there. Several suitors are trying to get to Daenerys--but mostly don't get there. Arya is learning to be invisible and to be an assassin--and actually makes progress. Ultimately, I appreciate what Martin is doing and I think he's adding key elements to a genre that has, to a large extent, offered its readers easy blacks and whites, simple solutions to complex problems. But I wanted to see more happen. Fans of this series could, I fear, skip the entire 959 pages and pick up the next volume without having to scratch their heads and wonder what has changed. The answer, to a large extent, is not much.Okay, I'm a fan of Martin's. Martin continues to be an effective wordsmith, continues to create a wonderfully complex world, continues to frustrate (and reward) his readers by refusing to let his characters find simplistic solutions to the problems they face. Overall, fans of this series (like me) will want to read A DANCE WITH DRAGONS. There's enough here to entertain and fascinate--but I do think it could have moved a bit faster."

But the thing is, for the most part these reviews only harp on the fact that ""oh, I've waited six years for Martin to finally finish it, but there's no epic battles/resolution/revelations"" etcetera and ""I waited so long for THIS? Oh man I'm done with the series"" blah blah blah. They don't actually talk about the story itself. And while I'm as critical of Martin for how absurdly long he makes his loyal readers wait between installments--especially since the argument could be made that a part of that wait is spent by him not spending as much time on writing as fans think he should--this isn't the place for those arguments. A book should be judged by its contents, not how long a reader waited for it.These people, while not completely unjustified in a lot of the criticisms they're raising--especially in the abundance of cliff hangers and open-ended storylines-- are missing the point of what, in my mind, makes A Song of Ice and Fire great--the characters, the unpredictable nature of where the plot's going to go, the wonderful world of Westeros and its environs, but again, most of all, the characters! Dance is much more about character development than other books in Martin's series, especially compared to Storm of Swords, in which almost every chapter involved some great action scene, or development, or advancement of the plot in some way.The pace here is more like that of Clash of Kings--and much better, not just barely better than Feast, which I think most will agree is the most slow-paced novel in the series. While it lacked epic scenes equivalent to the Battle of Blackwater, the wildlings' attack on the wall, or the Red Wedding, there's still plenty of solid content that should satiate most fans of the series, particularly the introduction of a storyline/group of characters that pretty much changes everything, and one cliffhanger for a certain character that I had to reread again, it was so exciting and unexpected.Again, its the characterization and not the war or overarching storyline that's the star of the show here. The POVs are essentially divided into three groups: those in the North and around the Wall reacting to the events of Mance Rayder's failed attack on the wall and Roose Bolton's rise to Warden of the North; Dany as she attempts to establish her role as Meereen's monarch and the various suitors and others attempting to reach her and her dragons; and a smattering of returning POVs from Feast for Crows which, while not completely resolving loose ends from the previous novel, do just enough to tie up those loose ends but leave the reader intrigued as to what happens next.The three main POVs are easily the most slowly paced, but they also have, in my mind, some of the best character development in the series. Jon is struggling to remain neutral in Stannis' efforts to win the north, while at the same time asserting himself as a strong commander. Tyrion has decided to embrace the image of the evil imp everyone else had wrongly made him out to be while trying to decide what to do with his life. And Dany makes decisions in her ruling of Meereen that may or not go against the destiny meant for her.I enjoyed the other POVs more than I did the main ones, but really, all of them, set the stage for what will hopefully be a brilliant next installment...whenever that may be. The new POVs (there are four--two are brand new characters and two are former periphery characters)are more or less welcome additions to the story, especially one of the new ones. Finally, Dance easily has the best one-shot POV (meaning prologue or epilogue) of the series so far.And the book isn't just nothing happening until the end as some are making it out to be--there is a HUGE revelation early on(not to mention another towards the end careless readers will miss), and one of the main POVs comes out of the gate really strong in a moment that had me cheering when I read it.No, it isn't perfect. But Martin can't make every installment of the series Storm of Swords or of its same exact caliber.Complaints for me include, that while cliffhangers aren't necessarily a bad thing, and some of them are excellent in this, others just left me going ""really? That's all we get?"" Martin definitely overuses his techniques of repeating phrases and describing food and fauna in a ton of detail. And while I enjoyed most of the POVs, I had a problem with two of the new ones--one only got one chapter, and the other, who was foreshadowed in the previous novel, just never became fully realized for me.But hey, at the end of the day, I got to be reunited with Jon, Dany, Tyrion, Bran, Davos, and other characters we haven't seen in years. And while there may not be a slambang, epic beheading, battle, or wedding people may have wanted as a reward for their long wait, there is still plenty of developments, and plenty of foreshadowing at things to come, that should leave most fans at least somewhat happy, or at the very least talking about and debating the events of Dance."

Im glad I didn't have to wait six years for this one like some people did. Now that I read it, I understand why many were disappointed. Its rather a bloated book. For one thing there is way too much description of family shields, clothing worn, and Westeros history - descriptions that if you read the previous four books, you already know for the most part. Way too much time was spent describing the various difficulties in traveling; yes, we get it, people get seasick a lot. Is it necessary to describe it each time it happens? The sections that take place off Westeros included way too many characters to keep track of. I found myself bored often and skimmed most of these sections (tho the part where Dany finally gets to fly was breathtaking). I also had trouble with the timeline - just how much time has passed here, and just how old are some of these leaders? Are Dany and Jon really only 15 or so? No wonder things are so screwed up. I did enjoy reading about Bran and Arya, but then they were sort of dropped and never heard of again. I loved that Cersei finally gets whats been coming to her for a long time, and loved Tyrion, as always. But he sorely needed an editor in this book, more so than any of his other books in the series. If it had been tighter narrative, this easily could have been a 4 star.That all being said - this was another page turner. I was hooked from the beginning, and while there were some sections I skimmed through, the story certainly kept my attention. As usual, he is a genius in characer development, and in showing the different facets of each character. I also appreciated of the new maps, but I wished he had made a character list in abc order, instead of by families, for easy reference. Hoping the next book happens soon, with tying up"

It was that engaging.

This is the throws of the Depression. He does what every man would do in his situation, hops a train to anywhere only to find out it is the circus train of The Benzini Bros. Greatest Show on Earth! As the show's veterinarian he forms a close relationship with crazy August (the equestrian trainer), his wife Marlena (a performer), and Rosie (the elephant). As the days go on, life on the circus gets crazier and crazier, until one day all hell breaks loose. What will Jacob do next?This book is narrated by two voices - that of the 90 something year old Jacob (retelling the events as he remembers them) and that of the 20 something year old Jacob (experiencing the events). The audiobook did an amazing job of casting two narrators and it made it one of the best books I have listened too. You were easily able to tell at what time you were by who was narrating and it made it feel so real.Gruen does an amazing job of researching the life of circus workers during the Depression. At no time did I feel that the details were out of place. You could feel the desperation of the roustabouts when they were continually not paid, resorted to drinking bootleg liquor, ran out of food. Reading this book was like stepping back in time.I loved this book! It is easily very near the top of my favorite books list. According to the authors website, Fox 2000 has purchased the rights to this book to make a movie and hear rumor that Reese Witherspoon might be cast as Marlena.

They are introduced to Hitler and members of the nazi hierarchy and so this historical epic begins. Revolving mainly around their two sons Byron and Warren the story takes us from the bombing of Warsaw to that fateful december morning at Pearl Harbour. When Victor Henry submits a report to his superiors predicting a secret pact between Russia and Nazi Germany and is proved correct his presence is immediately requested at the White House. From then on Roosevelt is impressed with what he sees and asks him to be his informal watchdog in Berlin and to keep his eyes and ears open. &quot;drop him a line every now and then&quot;. It is an assignment Victor Henry accepts with misgivings. The author weaves a convoluted tale of &quot;Pug&quot; Henrys meetings and confrontations with such historical figures as Roosevelt, Churchill, Mussolini and even Stalin. I learnt more here about major european battles and the background political drama than I ever learnt at college. It also captured the complicated politics of the time and explained the unlikly pact Hitler made with the soviets, their supposed arch enemies.It also dwelt in quite some detail with the intricacies of lend-lease which many americans were against at the time. Also with the fictional device of a memoir written by a retired wehrmacht general we are given a german perspective on the war and their reasons for its outcome. The germans Henry tells us laconically have a habit of blaming other countries for getting invaded by them. I had to nod in agreement at captain Henrys comment when asked by Roosevelt what he thought of Hitler &amp; Stalin. Henry's reply was that from his perspective most presidents and primeministers were more alike than they were different. Aint that the truth. The story also includes the romance, anguish, pain and suffering of war and all that entails. I also liked how the author descibed the ambience of the time. The streets of London and Berlin and Washington. What woman were wearing. What people were eating. It all just helped to create a more effective story. Give it a go even if you havent read a historical novel before you just might be surprised."

Fortunately for ""Lucky"" J. Aubrey, and the reader, Stephen Maturin, his erstwhile companion, ship's surgeon and naval intelligence agent arrives on the scene with a new command for Aubrey and a mission of the greatest importance to the Royal Navy. Two strategically critical islands in the southern Indian Ocean have been seized and fortified by the French navy, and turned into bases of operation for a handful of Bonaparte's frigates preying upon the British trade to and from India. Captain Aubrey, given the temporary rank of Commodore, is dispatched to take command of a squadron, coordinate with an expeditionary army regiment gathering nearby, and capture Mauritius and la'Reunion; as usual answering to the contrary ""at his own peril"". Stephen Maturin traveling with his old friend again is instructed by naval intelligence to utilize his own unique skills as an operative to bring the initiative back to the British forces. It is these islands, Mauritius and la'Reunion that provide the martial backdrop of this latest adventure in the Aubrey Maturin Series.The novel is one of O'Brian's better, which is saying a good deal- starting with this story's predecessor, ""HMS Surprise"", O'Brian begins to reach his real stride as the author of this much beloved series. Both Aubrey and Maturin are showcased, and their adventures are thrilling to read. Putting Aubrey to the test, he is given a squabbling set of Captains to manage, Army colleagues to coordinate and senior Admirals to dodge; not to mention the French frigates and ground forces as his adversaries. Stephen Maturin for his part deals with the intricacies of subversion, as well as his usual recollections on human nature, life at sea, and a growing addiction to laudanum- an opiate.Exciting, interesting, thought-provoking, at times funny; any Patrick O'Brian book is a good read, and this is one of his best."

I actually insisted my husband read it when I was done. He's not an easy man to please, but had to admit how much he enjoyed it as well. I purposely don't want to say too much about the story since I enjoy reading books ""fresh"" without too much advance information. The only negative I would say is that the ending was bit unbelievable to me. But by that time everything else was so great, I didn't really care.

Wouk (and his researchers) have provided us with a marvelous gift in this book, which presents a cleverly developed fictitious tale set among ALL of the major events and players of this real life drama.I am writing this review in March of 2008. The US is experiencing multiple financial crises in the housing, credit, and energy markets. We are at war with seemingly unobtainable goals. We are witnessing a baffling and discouraging presidential contest. Terrorism seems to rule nearly every aspect of our lives (and even so, we are one of the safest nations on Earth - in other words, it is much worse in other places . . . .). All of that stated, March of 2008 looks like a cakewalk compared to nearly any place in the world in the late 1930's and early 1940's, when fascist (and socialist, and imperialist) politics, rapidly developing war technologies, the last vestiges of old world European colonialism, and the overwhelming power of racism (anti-Semitism, among others), combined to change the maps of nearly every major power and realign the world for the time not yet ended. This masterful work of fiction sheds a fascinating light on the rise of this war, while also providing a great story.About the fiction of this work, Wouk invented an interesting family whose characters, all taken together, are present for active roles in just about every major event of the coming war. As such, this is like a modern Shakespearian classic - we are treated to the very human actions and emotions of legends (good and bad) through the eyes of Pug Henry and his family. What a hell of a book. At some regrettable points, the book borders on sappy, and some (and I stress, only a few) scenes are just not believable (like Warren Henry being shot down over Pearl Harbor, and dropping in at his house to see the wife before snagging another plane and getting back in the fight). These missteps are few and forgivable. The characters are universally flawed, which is a refreshing departure from the typical pop fiction approach - sometimes I would find myself angry with some of these characters and their actions - what a great reaction to pull out of your reader!This is a recommended book for war and history buffs, but I think it can be enjoyed by anyone who appreciates readable fiction - particularly fiction set in the mid-20th century. The ultimate compliment: when I finished this I did not hesitate to pick up Wouk's sequel, War and Remembrance. Awesome!"

It has been awhile since a book has had that type of impact on me. This book was excellent.I never really thought of the circus being around during the Great Depression. Everytime people hear 'Great Depresion' people automatically think of the soup kitchens and as Ms. Gruen put it 'hobo jungles'. I was pleased to learn a little bit about the circus during this time period and learn that there were harsh treatments and conditions of the animals AND workers in this book (which is horrible because I love animals, and people shouldn't be treated like nothing). I have read a few reviews regarding the volgar and violent content of the book. Let's face it, this is what happened (or at least similar to what was so to say). There were no strict enforcements on labor law or even animal laws such as PETA back then. This was life; workers and performers thought of it as such. It is unpleasant to read and even learn about but it was a different time and a different world. Just like other tragic times in history (wars, genocides, slavery, etc.). As for the volgar parts, like the sexual scenes, just part of life back then too and I suppose Ms. Gruen wanted it to be properly formatted.This book is very descriptive, and emotional, has an excellent plot and an unexpected ending. This was unlike any other endings to be honest, and I was shocked and pleased with it. The pauses between young Jacob and old Jacob got me too, just because I feel sorry for old Jacob and happy he's able to go back to an important time to him. Got you thinking about the people in those situations who have nobody left and feel like a burden to your family just to come visit.If you are looking for a love story, happy ending and action book, this book is for you! :) Five stars!"

However, so many people recommended this book to me that I finally bought it, and once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down!This is a wonderful story about the dark side of working on a traveling circus during the Great Depression. The story is told in flashbacks by Jacob Jankowski, a former circus worker who is now in his early nineties and living in an assisted living facility. Jacob recalls the tragedies that led him to jump a train one night and end up working as the resident veterinarian for the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth. There isn't really anything spectacular about working for a traveling circus, however, and this well-researched novels depicts the class issues between the performers and the workmen, the mistreatment of the animals, and the cruelty demonstrated by the show bosses. ""Water for Elephants"" is also a touching love story revolving around Jacob and Marlena, a beautiful performer who is trapped in an ugly and abusive marriage with one of the circus bosses.I absolutely loved this book. It's a real page-turner filled with dynamic characters, vivid descriptions, comical moments, and terrible heartache. ""Water for Elephants"" will have a place of honor in my bookcase for all time.

No matter, for Kim Stanley Robinson has invented a new universe... a universe for daydreamers and adventurers alike, a civilization of words born on that crimson neighbor floating in the night sky. Robinson may one day be known as the father of ""integrated-humanity"" fiction... he is at least at the vanguard of twenty-first century science fiction.Red Mars begins on colonized Mars in the middle of the twenty-first century. Under the pressurized tent city of Nicosia, Frank Chalmers, one of the original mission leads, sits in a state of stressful anticipation. He is planning something diabolical... to him, it's only politics. A festival of migrated humanity swirls about him... Arabs, Swiss, Americans, Russians, united in celebration. Then, as minutes pass, the crowd starts to quiet... news spreads. Fear and dread pass from person to person like a virus, and everyone scrambles. In the next several panic-filled moments, we are introduced to the primary leaders of this new Martian civilization... one of whom now lies dead.We now step back to an earlier date, December 2026, during the voyage from Earth to Mars. Maya Toitovna, official leader of the Russian contingent, is one of the one hundred men and women, primarily Russian and American scientists, who have embarked on this 300-day journey to the barren red world. As Mars draws closer, preparations are made, assignments handed out, and the political discussions ensue. Some will land on Phobos, one of two natural Martian satellites, others will begin construction of the first town. The lines of power are being drawn. But for now, everyone is excited about the endeavor in front of them... a new world, so much potential, the beginning of history... and so much to build! Ideals conflict, but there's enough planet and enough adventure for everyone.We learn much about Maya, too. A fierce temper to match her fierce beauty... a woman who could ""impale you with a look"", a woman not afraid to ""let the knives show"" when she thought a discussion was becoming irrational. She is a definite leader, and she contributes to every aspect of the endeavor. But she is anxious. She lays her sexual fingerprint on both American mission commanders, John Boone and Frank Chalmers... sometimes one of them occupies her moods. She is in control of everything, everything except her psychology. The confinement and the personality conflicts push against her. Demons are forming in the shadows of dreams.Robinson not only introduces us to Maya, John, Frank, and five or six other near-primary characters, he places their challenge in our mind, blending science, politics, and psychology with the extant cultures onboard. His vision is readily digestible, and we are hooked. The ship lands on Mars, and we turn to page 92.Nadia Cherneshevsky has plans for this red world. So she gets to work. ""Very quickly, she became the colony's chief troubleshooter, the universal solvent as John had called her."" As well as the colony's primary architect. She loves this enterprise more than any she's ever experienced... she works by herself and with others. ""There was something so fluid about tired muscles at the end of a day's construction work."" Her reputation grows as her ability shines. ""Mutual professional respect, a great maker of friendships. And so nice to talk about nothing but business."" Nadia lives through the arms of her machines, fueled by the world that will be. ""A compulsion, a life with a goal, how could you tell the difference?"" We are actually present as the first city evolves, fostered by this engineering Mother Ares. And we are still only 1/3 through this story!Red Mars is divided into 8 parts, each lived through a different primary character. We vicariously experience the colonization and expansion of Mars through Frank, Maya, Nadia, and mission commander John Boone, as well as Michel Duval, the psychiatrist and one member who didn't request this post, and Ann Clayborne, an irascible scientist who turns red-environmentalist. This forms within the reader an intense intimacy and understanding of each person's psychological makeup. When we discover the character of the pioneer killed in Part 1, we comprehend the profound loss to the group entire.But Red Mars isn't tragedy... it's sheer reality. Robinson writes the best ""science science-fiction"" of any major author out there. Arthur C. Clarke himself wrote of Red Mars: ""A staggering book... the best novel on the colonization of Mars that has ever been written... It should be required reading for the colonists of the next century."" Robinson's scientific research is impeccable, as is his awesome understanding of world cultures. The reader becomes a citizen of the world by first becoming a citizen of Mars.The men and women of Red Mars overcome much in this volume: the planet's forces, internal factions, the politics of city-building and immigration from Earth; and the joy is in the details. ""It was a world of acts, and words had no more influence on acts than the sound of a waterfall has on the flow of the stream."" This book spans decades of acts and actions, individual and collective. By the end of the book, Mars has undergone large-scale terraformation, introduction of biological agents, and mass emigration from Earth. The planet's potential has been noticed and exploited (in both positive and negative manner) by religious groups, transnational corporations, and Earth nation-states. The undercurrent of revolution is strong in this still colonial wilderness, and threatens to explode at any moment. (The subconscious parallels made to America in this book are utterly fascinating.)This is challenging fiction, written by the man who would probably be elected mission commander if the shuttle left for the red planet tomorrow. Robinson has so much to teach, and his work spans humanity like few authors before him, fully integrating technology, friendship, war, politics, government, sexuality, medicine, terraforming, psychology, environment, and science. This book would be a wise choice for a college humanities curriculum."

6,3.14,0.9973,1988,09-22,3269500,Mazzios,Palestine,,Richmond,East,13,"Man, I wanted to like this book. I really wanted to. I expected to be engrossed with it. I expected this book to provoke some deep thought and reflection in me. I thought the timing of my reading it was especially exciting, with the real-world preliminary discussion and planning for a true human mission to Mars possibly 20 years from now.What I did not expect was to give up on this book within 200 pages. But I did. And I'm pretty disappointed about that.The book's opening chapter involves a dramatic sequence involving several characters who are pretty clearly major players in the storyline. The narrative was B-rate, to be sure, but it was certainly good enough to continue reading, especially to give the story a chance to get its legs under it and really start moving.The next chapter covered the long voyage through space to Mars and what the voyagers had to do to prepare themselves for the red planet as well as passing the time as bored people with social needs in a confined place. Again, not an engrossing narrative, but it introduced secondary players and further developed the primary players, albeit as not much more than soap opera characters trying to negotiate love triangles and power grabs.In the third (massive) chapter, the voyagers finally reach Mars and touch the surface -- and this novel instantly turns into the near equivalent of a graduate-level geology textbook, and any joy or enthusiasm or intrigue or interest I had at that point utterly evaporated. Pages and pages and pages and pages and pages of descriptions about the different colors and textures of the Martian sand. Pages and pages and pages and pages about the different colors and textures and angles and depth of the ice at the Martian north pole. Pages and pages and pages and pages about the equipment that was needed to mine Martian resources and use the ice as a water source. Every now and then a character would display an exaggerated emotion in a quick, superficial way -- I guess just to show you that these characters are supposed to be distinct, real people and that these personalities would clash...eventually...as some point...if their geological expedition ever ended. But before those clashes would come, you'll have to read more pages and pages and pages and pages about the different angles the sun takes in the Martian sky based on the unique rotation and orbit of the planet.I mean, come on.I asked three people I know who have read through the book if I should give up or keep reading. Two of them encouraged me to keep reading but one told me to stop. But all three of them agreed that it was at times an excruciatingly boring read. And while I do like hard science-fiction, and I do enjoy the slower, dryer, more deliberate pace that much of hard sci-fi follows, that third, seemingly endless chapter of Red Mars killed the pleasure of reading for me.From what I've been told, the last quarter of the book gets exciting and intriguing. But I'm not trudging through days of joyless reading to get to it.I just don't understand the mindset of some authors -- especially in sci-fi and fantasy. It's almost like they challenge you to read hundreds of boring pages to make you &#34;earn&#34; your way to the good parts. I don't think it's unreasonable to expect a novel to move at a steady pace from page 1 and sustain that pace more or less until the final page. It's not like I read it for only the first 10 pages, and said, &#34;This thing is BORING! Screw it!&#34; I almost got to page 200, and it was a burden to read one paragraph more. That's not why I pick up a novel. And I doubt it's why you do, either.Note: I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because I do applaud the effort the author put into writing a book like this. I was impressed by the depth of scientific knowledge. Unfortunately, in writing the book, the author did not have a keen sense of when to pull back on the scientific detail and let a moving plot take over."

5,2.91,0.992,2002,03-26,7753500,Whole Foods Market,Henderson,,UCLA,West,8,"Patrick French's biography of Francis Younghusband - `the last great imperial adventurer' - is beautifully written, insightful and above all humane. I say humane because at first glance Younghusband could easily be ridiculed - in his youth for a reckless jingoism that cost lives and embarrassed the British government, and in his later years for a brand of religious mysticism that was, well, bordering on insane. It is a tribute to French's understanding of his subject that he digs beneath these criticisms to bring us a deeply satisfying portrait of a surprisingly complex man.Frank Younghusband's most pressing claim on history was that he led the British expedition into Tibet in 1904 - even at the time seen as being based on a flimsy pretext of stopping Russia from gaining control of central Asia. Some 2000 Tibetans were killed as the British force made its way into Lhasa. Younghusband forced a treaty on the 13th Dalai Lama pledging loyalty to the British empire. The Government in London found this deeply embarrassing and almost immediately repudiated the treaty. Younghusband himself was convinced of the threat Russia presented to British interests in India and central Asia.But while the expedition created popularity and profile in England, it finished any chances of a senior career with the civil service. Younghusband served in India in a number of middle-ranking posts and wrote books about Tibet and his earlier exploits as an explorer in central Asia. In 1906 he played a bit part in the Jamison raid in South Africa - in the pay of The Times. Most importantly Younghusband thought about spirituality. Literally following a mountain top revelation in Tibet, he increasingly devoted his life to promoting a form of all-embracing spirituality which led in its silliest form to speculations about aliens living on a planet called Altair. His later years were devoted to boosting this form of spirituality by establishing popular movements in England, lecturing widely including in the US, running the Royal Geographic Society and supporting Indian independence.All of which one could easily ridicule. But French brings life to his subject and a subtlety of understanding which makes the book absolutely engrossing. One reason is that Younghusband was a prolific letter writer - the India Office Library contains 600 ""bulging"" boxes containing his papers. Through these we see into the private mental world of Francis - his arid and rather sad marriage to Helen, and the relationship in his very last years with Madeline Lees - truly the love of his life. These insights allow French to paint a much deeper and satisfying portrayal of a complex man - a person of his time and place but also a complete iconoclast, some one who pushed against the establishment for most of his life. Remarkably, this is Patrick French's first book, written in his mid-twenties. He is a natural, a gifted writer with a fine sense of judgement. No sentence rings out of tune in the whole book. In short Younghusband is worth every one of its five stars. If the publishers have any sense they will issue a reprint soon. If not, readers should do everything they can to somehow find a copy of this wonderful biography."

His boldness shows in every page - writing biology, chemistry, physics, astrophysics - he has made himself a target for scientific specialists of all kinds. As a layman, I have no way of knowing if he stayed true to the facts but I do understand that his research has taken too much of his stamina in the process of writing the book.""Red Mars"" comes out a bit ""dry"" as Robinson insists on outstretched portrayls of the Martian landscape and its terraforming. The reason for this is obviously setting the stage in the reader's minds but when this is accompanied with a lack of character's ""roundness"", the bottom line is disappointing.Another tendency of the author is choosing to depict major events, like the revolution, from a passive angle of those who's participation is marginal, (if at all). And even when main characters are at the center of major events, the reader does not find himself swept with emotions. You don not ""feel"" the action and the character.The positive aspetcs of the book are: (A)the plot by itself is a creative achievement and (B)the ideological premise of the story - the tyranny of Corporate Capitalism - is highly relevant today. These two are the source of my disappointtment with ""Red Mars"".Hopefully Robinson has done a better job in the sequels."

6,3.06,0.99226,1991,01-25,9212300,Beautiful Day Cafe,Wichita,,Georgia,Southeast,11,"Ernest Hemingway - For Whom The Bell TollsFor one who wants to read the book that has it all I recommend Ernest Hemingway's For Whom The Bell Tolls. Friendship, strife, security, terror, love, war, good, evil; this book has them all. It is the story of Robert Jordan, a sympathizer of the Republicans in the Spanish Civil War, whose duty is to lead a band of guerrillas in blowing up a bridge as part of a Republican offensive. Along the way Jordan will learn the revolting pasts of several of the guerrillas, fall in love with one of them, and spend quite some time meditating on ""truths"" he was once sure he knew.No sooner has Jordan met with the guerrillas than he discovers that one of them, fearful of being hunted down by the fascist forces, stands against him and threatens to take the entire group away. This first taste of tension is mirrored several times over in Hemingway's gripping novel as Jordan's quest to destroy his bridge turns into a contemplation of whether his cause is truly worthy or not.Much of what Jordan sees recommends the latter. Jordan's guerrilla partners are not simple adornments to his crusade; they all have livid pasts and he finds much to learn from them. Even as they curse and spit at the fascists several of these guerrillas communicate, through their stories, arguments against the futility and cruelty of the war they have willfully taken up. Others, too young to realize what they have gotten into, create commentaries on war through their nave brashness.Additionally the humanity of the guerrillas makes Jordan question the commands from his isolated, detached superiors. In time Jordan forms strong bonds with his friends and discovers that the thought of sending them into harm's way is not a simple abstraction. This is further complicated by a girl Jordan meets and falls in love with and Jordan's own questions about the worthiness of his orders.Like Robert Jordan we, as readers of For Whom The Bell Tolls, are invited to meditate on many of the thoughts that so bother him. What need a person do to live a full life? How important is it to stay true to principles, even when fighting in vain? What are the limits of brutality? These are a few of the questions Hemingway grapples with in his book. The answers are so well bound with the narrative that often one hardly notices a metaphysical discussion has occurred, but those who give the text a second look will find a philosophical subtext as gripping as the plot line.As for the story, Hemingway creates out of his assortment of characters a narrative of breathtaking beauty. For Whom The Bell Tolls has the power to move one to tears, wet hands with sweat, and force page after page of devoted reading. Hemingway's language is not the most beautiful, but in lieu of poetics his writing has the next best thing: crisp clarity.Perhaps the best thing to say about For Whom The Bell Tolls is that at nearly 500 pages (which glide by in a snap), scarcely one has been wasted. It is a war novel laced with the drama of a Henry James piece and a drama lacerated with the carnage of war. In other words this fine book of Hemingway's manages to transcend two genres and end up at some unknown point in between, but certainly above both."

As a fellow fan, I can't help but pick it up to figure out what happens to the story. But did anything really happen? That's an arguable point.Let's talk about the enjoyable things before getting to the more unpleasant parts of this review:Martin is a great writer. No matter how slow the story is moving, I still didn't want to put the book down. Martin's writing really brings the world to life. His descriptions of cities and markets and people makes a vivid image in your mind. In the current fictions climate where descriptions are minimal, it is a refreshing change, but it could also be annoying to the readers who are used to ""action action and action"" books instead of a book that brings the world alive with vivid details.It is also hard to think of exceptionally good things about this book, just because this is mainly a book that pushes things along at a snail pace. As others have stated, things can happen much faster. There're just chapters and chapters and chapters of events that were useless. **Spoiler ahead: **For example, from the beginning to the end, war threatens Mereen, but does it actually happen? No.** With this long of a book, you'd think there would be more life-changing, well, at least more surprising twists around the corner. I'm not saying there arent, but there are just not enough for the length of this book.Martin does have a way to grip readers if only because I want to know what happens even though nothing happens chapter after chapter. After every page, for every chapter, I keep hoping something important will happen, but usually I am left with disappointment. Yet still I go on reading, because I do care. I still care about the characters, old and the new.Nothing much left to say. If you read the previous ones and is a fan, then it's a must read, if only to continue the series. If not, then you shouldn't be looking at this review. Read the first book and decide for yourself."

Although there are scenes of battles, they are told either (a) from the perspective of an observer (i.e. Pug Henry seeing the battle unfolding); (b) or as a historical overview of what happened during the battle. So, in answer to the negative review that this book contained no major military battles: it isn't that kind of book. Winds of War is essentially a story about the Henry family and Pug and Byron in particular against the backdrop of the rise of the Third Reich. Both Pug and Byron have vastly different love interests and the book interweaves their love stories with the events that lead up to the attack on Pearl Harbor. Of course, the book is so much more that a romance novel. Wouk takes his main characters from the German invasion of Poland, to England during the Battle of Britain, to Moscow during Operation Barbarossa, and finally to Pearl Harbor and Manilla Bay. (with lots of other ports of call in between). Interspersed in the book are excerpts from a fictional book written by a german general after the war (and after Neuremburg). These excerpts give a fascinating look into the &quot;german side&quot; of the war. Wouk also uses these excerpts to give historical context to many of the battles and events which occur behind the scenes. Winds of War doesn't merely tely a story, it attempts to describe why certain events occurred. For example, the characters in the book don't merely react to Hitler and call him every bad name in the book; certain of the characters actually discuss why they think Hitler rose to power. Wouk then takes the character's opinions on certain events to help explain their conduct and make it more believable (for instance, Aaron Jastrow seems to lack concern when faced with the prospect of Nazi rule in part because of his knowledge of history and what he believes history tells him about the German people.) Each of the main characters is wonderfully unique and Wouk does an amazing job of keeping all the characters distinct, to the point where I could anticipate certain reactions (like Slote's nervous giggle in times of high stress). This is the fastest 1000 page book you will ever read."

When you are sorrowful look again in your heart, and you shall see that in truth you are weeping for that which has been your delight."" G. K. Gibran, The ProphetThe Prophet:Gibran's best-known work, The Prophet, is a collection of poetic essays, which became more popular with the rise of American New Age movement during the 1960s. Since its first publication in 1923, The Prophet has never been out of print. It was translated into more than twenty languages, and became one of the twentieth century best selling books, in the United States. The Prophet evoked the journey of the Promeathian exile, he called Al Mustafa (the Chosen One, one of Islam's prophet favorite adjectives). Gibran added to the work, a separate work he had attached to the story of Al Mustafa. Gibran has later linked the roots of his poetic collection to a work he wrote as a teenager in Arabic.Quote from The Prophet, Self-knowledge:*Your hearts know in silence the secrets of the days and the nights.But your ears thirst for the sound of your heart's knowledge.You would know in words that you have always known in thought.You would touch with your fingers the naked body of your dreams.*And it is well that you should.The hidden well-spring of your soul must needs rise and run murmuring to the sea; and the treasure of your infinite depths would be revealed to your eyes.But let there be no scales to weigh your unknown treasure;And seek not the depths of your knowledge with staff or sounding line.For self is a sea boundless and measureless.G. Khalil Gibran, 1883-1931:I encountered Gibran as a young kid, even before appreciating Arabic poetry. I was then amazed by the beauty of his art and the romance of his expression, in 'The Prophet.' I read him, later in Arabic, before I realized how the Lebanese emigrant poet has touched the Western hearts. Gibran's collection of early stories, parables and poetic prose, were written in Arabic before his works were translated into English, earning him the nickname 'the Shelly of the Orient.' Many Arabic speaking intelligentsia, including my dad thought he has qualified, before Naguib Mahfouz was elected, to have been the first Nobel Laureate Arabic writer !Classic Book Reviews:""It is Gibran's gift to us, as well, for Gibran's prophet is rivaled in his wisdom only by the founders of the world's great religions. --his words have a power and lucidity that in another era would surely have provoked the description ""divinely inspired.""

Many of the extraordinary incidents in this novel, according to the author's notes, are rooted in oral history or based on anecdotes or actual written reports of those early 20th century years. Those who rode the circus rails, many being family castaways and society's rejects, found family and home in that unique traveling milieu of humanity and managerie, and, in the process, grew tough in body and spirit. BUT, even if you don't give a hoot about circuses or circus people, don't be put off by the title or theme. (Although, is there really anyone in their 30s plus years who did not, as a child, sit and watch wide-eyed, delighting in the cheap glitz, the pulsating music, the flamboyant and rhinestone-studded costumes and, yes, the size and smell of the elephants, when the circus came to town?) This story is nostalgic in its telling, engaging in its characters, with a plot that clearly aligns the good guys against the bad. There are wonderful descriptions of authentic circus activity, on-site intrigue, and a romance that you will really care about. All of this, tucked into the ruminations of a contentious 90-year-old ""assisted-living"" resident whom you will also really care about.I suspect, however, one would have to have a soft spot for animals to want to open this novel and then to inhale it, as I did, in just a day and a half. Like savoring a wonderful dessert, I was torn between the discipline of consuming it in small lady-like portions and making it last for as long as possible or just gobbling it down and enjoying it all at once."

This is one rare occasion where I loved the movie more than the book (but that may just be because I saw the movie first.) In some ways this is like an amped up romance novel. There's so much focus on the romance between Jacob and Marlena but she has the personality of a wet napkin so I really don't get the appeal. When I read the negative reviews for this book a lot of people made issue with the "" graphic and frequent sex scenes"" it made me somewhat hesitant to read it but those concerns were unfounded. There was some sex, and some thoughts of sex and some lit nips BUT the story is being told by a sex-deprived geriatric/ a horny teenage VIRGIN! If anyone was shocked that a 19yo was obsessed with scoring a little trim they should walk directly off the nearest cliff. It was a bit more detail than necessary but I've read sex scenes that made me cringe from the details and this wasn't that. If I had to list my own personal complaints I would start with the ending, that was literally my biggest issue with this novel. There are some big, gaping, elephant sized holes my friends. I mean, what did they do, stand around Bumpuckey West Nowhereland with 12 horses and and elephant for however many days until Ringling could come pick them up? I mean I get that it was a happy ending, the sun will come out tomorrow etc. but the author basically did a Sopranos style fade to black. What about the other animals?! Whatever, don't get me started, I could go off on an all day tangent.... point is there was something to be desired. My favorite parts of the book were mostly centered around Old Jacob, he was by far the best written (and my favorite) character. Curious as to why they cut the Rosemary character out of the movie, because their relationship was a nice really sweet. Overall it was a good read, I enjoyed traveling back in time to the circus and I am willing to overlook the flaws to take the trip."
5,3.34,0.99368,1992,10-29,3271600,Royal Greens Vegetarian,San Jose,,South Florida,West,11,"The colonization of the Solar System has been a big topic in science fiction for decades, and yet no book on the subject has met with as much success as Kim Stanley Robinson's Mars series. The explanation is simple. When writing these books, Robinson went to great lengths to include every aspect of how human life would change on another planet. When describing the first manned mission to Mars and the experience of the &quot;First Hundred&quot; settlers, he looks in depth at all sorts of topics ranging from psychology (How would it feel to be constantly faced by a planet that appeared completely different from Earth?) to the politics of terraforming (Would everybody agree to plans to introduce life and create a biosphere on Mars, or would some people resist?) Robinson displays solid scientific knowledge in an incredible array of fields, and carefully weaves descriptions of the scientific progress that gets made into the story of the settlers' efforts to colonize the planet.One of the best facets of &quot;Red Mars&quot; is the incredible description of the landscapes of Mars. Robinson gives a lot of thought to the topic of what the planet would actually look like to explorers standing on it from ground level. These sequences help set this book apart from other efforts where the planet is simply described as being red and rocky and left at that. When reading these descriptions, you can't help but share the belief of some of the characters that Mar's desolate terrain has its very own form of beauty. Of particular note are the landscapes during one character's voyage to the polar ice cap near the start of &quot;Red Mars&quot;, and when a group of characters are navigating a dangerous canyon near the book's conclusion. Robinson also makes good use of the unique elements of geology and weather on Mars. For instance, when there's a gigantic dust storm on the planet, he gives convincing portrayals not just of the storm itself, but also of the depressing and claustrophobic effect that it has on the settlers when they aren't able to see more than a few feet when outdoors.The story is told from the perspective of several different characters, each of them being the center of attention for about fifty pages. Some critics have complained about the quality of characterization in Robinson's books. It's definitely true that they don't have the same complexity as characters should have in true literature. However, they are satisfactory for telling the story that the author wants to tell. When two people have a discussion or argument in &quot;Red Mars&quot;, it actually sounds genuine and convincing, and there are some interesting looks at how differences in policy and worldview affect the relationship between characters.As a conclusion, let me say something in response to those reviewers who insist on judging the book by the author's politics rather than by the content of the book itself. &quot;Red Mars&quot; contains some amount of political and social commentary, although it occupies only a fairly small portion of the six hundred page work. For instance, there's a brief section where one character must resolve a dispute between business leaders and laborers who are upset about their living conditions on Mars. Well, this is just another example of what I mentioned earlier, which is that Robinson carefully considered every aspect of what conditions would be like for early settlers on another planet, and his explanation of the situation struck me as being very realistic. In Robinson's vision of the future, gigantic corporations work to undermine and supplant national governments on Earth as well as to control Mars; some have complained that this is unrealistic. But those of us who keep up with world events know that we're already starting to see the beginning of such a trend right now, so there''s nothing unreasonable about predicting that it will continue in the future."

Do yourselves a favor, like me, and take this excellent journey with this gifted author. Water for Elephants, by Sara Gruen, is a very moving story about relationships and family. When Jacob Jankowski loses his family, he actually joins the circus. Not because he wanted to, but because it presented itself. Fortuantely, Jacob was studying to become a veterinarian and the circus was full of animals. The story is told from the perspective of Jacob as an elderly man and Jacob as a young man.The relationships that Jacob forms during this excellent novel form the corserstone of the story. I found myself caring about a grouchy dwarf and his 3-legged dog, as well as an elephant, and a cast of numerous colorful characters. The evocative descriptions of the circus itself - the Benzini Brothers; a wannabee Ringling Brothers - during the Depression; actually put you on a railcar with the smell of dust all around you. This is certainly no glamorous lifestyle, and Gruen does an exceptional job of providing vivid imagery. The menagerie that Jacob helps care for are an important piece of this wide ranging cast that features individuals that are easy to hate and aome that are easy to love. Jacob meets Marlena, who is married to the evil August, and the relationships that ensue become increasingly complicated.I now know more about circuses that I ever knew I wanted to. I am glad that I do, because the learning was all part of the great fun to be had here. This is a very entertaining and compelling book. I could not read it fast enough, yet I felt myself wanting to slow down to enjoy it all the more. I rate this a highly recommended 5 stars. Enjoy!"

To be short: the fifth book in the series cannot be compared to the previous four. Sadly, I have to say, ""A Dance with Dragons"" kills almost all the forward momentum of the first four books :-((The following sections contain spoilers, beware.)What's wrong with this book? Almost everything. First of all, it was a very bad idea to go back to the time of the events of ""Feast for Crows"". The first half of the book covers the same period as the ""Feast for Crows"". This part is simply boring. The second half of the book is more interesting but the events we are told about simply do not fit into the big picture. The worst part about ""A Dance with Dragons"" is that almost all the characters lost their wits and their behavior is simply stupid. Let's discuss some details.- Daenerys - the change in her in the book is just nonsense, her decisions are simply stupid; the wise and compassionate future queen of Westeros became a gullible, hysterical, lazy and wanton girl. And Meereen is not interesting, it is simply annoying, all the characters we get to know in this city are selfish and disgusting, and anyway, who cares about the Slavers' Bay? Does it have any connections with the main story? It has none. At least, in the end Daenerys leaves this wretched city...- Quentyn Martell - his story, for me, was the biggest mistake in the whole series. We read a lot about Dorne and the scheming of Doran Martell in the previous book. At the end of the previous book it was revealed that the big secret is that the prince of Dorne is sent to Daenerys. Wow, it could have been interesting... Major spoiler here: all this fuss about Dorne, the sand snakes, Arys Oakheart and so on, what is the result of all this? Quentyn dies without any result whatsoever, he and all the Dornish scheming achieved absolutely nothing! This part is really frustrating because why invest a lot into a detailed, and good story? Just to give an abrupt and stupid ending? I am not against killing off the characters, I was blown away by the Red Wedding, because it made sense, Quentin's story is simply unnecessary.- Prince Aegon - did this new twist in the story add anything to the big picture? No, on the contrary. The more new characters we have, the more likely it becomes that a lot of side stories will not be wrapped up at the end. Are Aegon an his companions interesting characters? Unfortunately, the answer is no. Up until this fifth book Martin managed to avoid most of the fantasy clich&eacute;s, Aegon and his team is simply too bland, and mostly unnecessary and clich&eacute;d (the good but spoilt prince with his loyal and wise counselor is one of the biggest fantasy clich&eacute;). Was the story in such a dire need for another contender for the iron throne?I could continue with all the characters in the book, none of them moved forward. Even Tyrion, who is still the best character in the book, became shallow. And what about this girl dwarf? Really?Yes, I am angry with this book, because the first four books were masterpieces, this one is ordinary. I cannot give it more than two stars."

The audio quality was excellent and the narrator did a good job; he spoke with a slight Spanish accent, which seemed to fit well with the narrative. He did some characterizations with his voice, but not much compared to other narrators I've listened to.This is the second time that I have read this novel; the first time was over 30 years ago in high school. It's amazing to me how differently I looked at this book this time around. The first time I read it; I saw it as an adventure story with some interesting character development. The second time around I read it as a fascinating look at how war brings out the best and worst in people.I feel that Hemingway accurately captured how certain people would act in a civil war; the cruelty by some and acts of courage by others. In all cases, the characters were in a situation where there were no great options. He also accurately showed that there are good people on both sides of a conflict; that soldiers do suffer by taking the lives of others.As a Spanish speaker; I enjoyed Hemingway's use of language. Most of the unique use of English is actually a direct literal translation of Spanish. I hadn't heard the phrases directly translated that way before, but immediately recognized them as common Spanish slang.This is a book worth reading; you will learn that life is not always black and white."

It did include one of my favorite characters, so it was okay by me. Mr. Martin surly makes audacious moves with his characters, and there are no rules to his writing. He has created an Epic fantasy world with Game of Thrones. His fantasy world is created with vivid detail of time, places and events. At times it is hard to keep all the Houses in order. Winter has yet to come, so I am still hanging in there for the finally. I also watch the HBO hit series. All in all, a great piece of work, masterly crafted!"

I'll pass on criticizing the weak writing & the obvious lack of credible research (various other one star reviews have covered that) and instead attack the characters: Jacob is a stupid d**che, Marlena is a stupid tw*t, and August is just an a-hole.Jacob is supposed to be a vet/animal caretaker but what does he do? He lets August repeatedly beat the bejeesus out of Rosie, the elephant. But as soon as Marlena, August's tw*tty wife, appears with a black eye Jacob goes bonkers and attacks August. Okay... Really?! I'm not brushing off wife-beating here, but really?! One flipping black eye and August deserves to die? I would have killed that bastard for beating AND torturing Rosie LONG BEFOREHAND!! And then Jacob keeps harping about it: ""He hit her! He hit her! He hit her!"" Well, so what? It's not like she was tied to a stake like Rosie was. And the only reason she had the black eye was because August thought she was having an affair with Jacob! And then the author uses ""paranoid schizophrenia"" to explain August's behavior? Seriously?! He's just a possessive prick! With good reason to be ""paranoid,"" turns out, since Jacob really IS after his wife.The only main character that wasn't completely unlikable, really, was Walter aka Kinko but Jacob got him killed by being *gasp!* a stupid d**che.I'm not surprised this book is so popular, though. It's a simple, easy read with little to no thinking required."
6,3.44,0.98819,2013,07-19,7220400,Design and Dine  Eat• Drink• Paint,Las Vegas,,New Mexico St,Midwest,13,"Ernest Hemingway's FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS is not only a war novel but also a story of life, love, lost and ultimately death. Robert Jordan lives to fight with the republican guerillas and he dies fighting alongside them. He lived a life that meant more to him than living in American suburbia with his wife and two children and a dog, working a nine-to-five job. That wouldn't be Robert Jordan, or Ernest Hemingway.Hemingway's minimalist writing reflects the pristine snow trails and pine forests, which reflect loneliness and death but also love and hope. Like a full moon reflected in a still lake. A poetry of war and camaraderie, where the violence of the writing would only temper the tragedy of lost. To experience these feelings is to experience the beauty of Hemingway's writing. For a war novel, there aren't many battle scenes. But we get to feel Robert Jordan's subdued emotions against the violence of war. The power of his love for Maria is that it couldn't be consummated. In the end, he chooses the only path consistent with his other choices: to fight to the end and risk capture and torture rather than have his comrades shoot him."

The main stages here are the Wall and Slavers Bay with a secondary stage of Dorne, the Iron Isles and Kings Landing. Briefly mentioned are the Riverlands and Winterfell.There are as usual unexpected deaths at the end, Tyrion's interesting adventures and the sudden return of almost forgotten characters. I wasn't interested in Arya's adventures nor Bran's in this installment. Both of them seem to be no longer a part of the main narrative and are just added in for completeness and to fill up pages. Of course this is only going off of what we have so far. The main thing to remember about all this is that anyone can die and the only constant is the rat race for the Iron Throne.It is definitely true that there are just too many throw away characters in this one it can be hard to care much about them or their plotlines. The Wildlings/Crows and all the many characters of Slavers Bay etc. make it hard to follow. It seems that the characters of Slavers Bay and the Wildlings/Crows will be forgotten once the previously introduced main characters that are there move on in life or death. They are only in bulk to be thought of as one large character kind of like the Wights or the Dragons. I found myself feeling like the proverbial ""are we there yet"" kids.The whole split chronology is a detriment as well. It means that almost half the characters are not reacting or participating in any of the events of the other half, splendid isolation in time and place. Are the messenger crows not working here? This splitting is one reason why this novel is so unfocused it's almost as if Martin is just adding stuff to keep his page count up. The constant retelling of the near past is annoying. He could have written Parts 4 and 5 as one book and cut out a lot of unnecessary details and people that showed up in Part 5. This wouldn't have worked for the marketing dept. though: the release schedule and premier dates dictate too much. I think that's part of why he keeps changing the number of books. I wouldn't be surprised if he extended it to 10 books. We may have a new LOST on our hands here!I have to say that it's a definite liability that this and it's sequels are being fleshed out while a TV show is being produced of the series. This all smells too much of marketing to me, wasn't it around the start of Season 2 TV show that this novel debuted? Was the series even extended simply for cash and future TV seasons? I think this makes the rest of the books very reactive and subservient to the needs of HBO(the dragons largely disappear conveniently must be a TV/graphics budget issue) and weakens Martins credibility as a writer: but I guess once a TV writer always a TV writer. It's almost as if you should just skip the first 500-700 pages and just read the rest to get the gist of the novel. So, the next novel will be released in April 201X(near TV premiere time) or thereabouts I'm sure. There isn't even a preview of the next novel in this one at the end like the first four books, ominous sign that.In short it's worth a read but don't expect the tight focused story of the first four or the introduction of any new characters you'll care much about."

6,3.3,0.99272,2012,09-19,7822500,Cali An American Eatery,San Francisco,,Norfolk St,West,15,"""Partisans"" is one of those disappointing adventure novels that build up a nice head of steam before crashing into a wall.During World War II, a Yugoslavian agent under apparent German command takes a team of compatriots deep into his native country, where Italian, German, and their Cetnik ""allies"" watch each other as suspiciously as they do their Partisans foes. The agent, Petersen, has a message to deliver, though what that message is and who he has to deliver it to is a mystery.What makes ""Partisans"" enjoyable is the leisurely way it begins, with much circuitous banter and some dark doings on darkened city streets and aboard an Italian torpedo boat. You know Petersen can't be working for the Nazis, but what about those with him? Who can he trust? Who can we trust? One settles in expecting a variant of the commando tales MacLean famously presented in such books as ""The Guns Of Navarone"" and ""Where Eagles Dare,"" though laced with a welcome sardonic edge courtesy of Petersen.Agreeing an attempted assassination against them was committed by amateurs, Petersen adds: ""But the effect of an amateur bullet can be just as permanent as a professional one.""Or take his impression of an Italian officer he meets: ""He's reasonable, personable, smiling, open-faced, has a firm handshake and looks you straight in the eye - anyone can tell at once that he's a member of the criminal classes.""As the novel goes on, you begin to realize it isn't going anywhere, that the banter is all you will get. The plot advances only because Petersen and his group keep getting captured by various forces who then leave them unharmed, which Petersen explains is part of his mysterious plan. A rotund pal drinks alcohol by the quart, while another keeps a strange, surly silence. A couple of women along for the trip call Petersen a ""monster,"" then break into tears over such things as having to ride a pony over a mountain.More annoyingly, one never is able to work out what Petersen is up to until the end of the novel, at which point he explains it all to you and his comrades in such a roundabout way none of it makes much sense.Maybe he was having a poke at the au currant thrillers of the time. When ""Partisans"" was published in 1983, MacLean was struggling with a form of novel he helped popularize but which had been picked up by more sophisticated writers like Frederick Forsyth and Ken Follett, who jammed labyrinthine storylines into books twice as large as MacLean's. Of course, MacLean's simpler stories could be quite wonderful, too, but here we are handed a plot so convoluted no one could understand it. Even the flap jacket for the original hardcover describes a story with little resemblance to what's in the book.That's a shame, because ""Partisans"" has the makings of a good tale, with interesting characters and a charged background of multiple, conflicting loyalties running riot in an exotic locale. MacLean throws a lot of plates in the air, and you wonder how he is going to get them all down. Then he surprises you by letting them crash to the floor."

Robinson manages to elaborate on points from the most mundane issues of gossip, affairs, and body image; to...well the colonization of Mars. RED MARS is an important work, and I think well grounded, on the relationship between human beings and their place of dwelling. Mars is a living creature here, and mankind manages to twist it in every way from our ideas, objectification, and the inevitable destruction at the hand of these conflicting views.This book is a must for any fan of hard science-fiction. A passionate, researched, and thorough account of the theoretical colonization of Mars...with the occasional lull of thirty to forty pages of terrain under its scientific name, under scientific terms."

Rating Dance with Dragons would be like rating only one chapter from The Three Musketeers and saying how flawed the novel is because the passage is weaker than the rest. I think Mr. Martin deserves a whole galaxy of stars, and I, for one, will thank him for his labors and wait patiently for the next installment. This said, I would give minus 5 stars to Mr. Martin's publishers. Those people have been getting not fat, but obese on royalties from ASOIAF, and you'd think they might use a tiny amount of those profits to pay someone to read and edit Mr. Martin's text. This is what editors do, it's their job. I have a score of things in mind, but I will take only one example : in AFFC, Sam escorts Maester Aemon and Gilly south. On the way, it is borne on him that Gilly's misery is not the result of seasickness or homesickness, but of having had to give up her baby. This was a beautiful use of POV. Things were happening, the plot was moving forward (slowly admittedly), and Mr. Martin saved us a piece of melodramatic narrative by having the truth pieced together retrospectively by a naive, unsuspecting narrator. Beautiful. Then comes Dance with Dragon with a Jon chapter plodding over the episode at length, telling us nothing we do not know in a much less effective and dramatic way, obliterating the sheer elegance of the previous Sam POV. And why ? Because Mr. Martin probably jotted down a storyline in the first place, then had the various events told by different narrators, played about with the POVs, then juggled with chapters and possibly forgot to edit the passage from the Jon POV. But that, to my mind, was not Mr. Martin's job. That was the job of an editor, one who was not so close to his stuff that he had difficulty stepping back and viewing the architecture of the series from a distance. Editing out the Jon POV was the job of his publishers. Dear Mr. Martin, you are my hero, I'm reading A Dance with Dragons and savoring every minute of it, but frankly, your publishers suck."

I really enjoyed ""The Voyage Out"" and the character development (even though, for me, the characters were not very likable). When they got to Mars, the book seemed to slow way down. The same features of Mars are explained over and over again. The author only has to tell me once that the sand/cliff/mountain/sky/terrain is red/rust/orange/crimson/brown/tan...I get it already! I do agree with other reviewers who say that 150-200 pages of describing Mars could have been left out to make a much more enjoyable book.The parts about the colonization were technically interesting, but overpowered with political issues (not a favorite SciFi topic of mine). While I think the events were a realistic expectation for people under such a situation, it just makes for very dry reading.

7,3.23,0.99444,2014,10-02,11051100,Jeannie's,Tulsa,,North Dakota St,West,12,"This is one of the greatest modernist novels to deal with the subject of war. Set during the Spanish Civil War of the 1930s, this novel explores war as it really is, not as what it is glorified or vilified to be according to the whims of a journalist or novelist. There is very little of the actual war in the foreground of the plot--the entire novel spans only about four days--but the relationships of the characters and their interaction with one another allows the reader to see what war is like from the viewpoint of those who participate in it. Like Crane's The Red Badge of Courage, this book deals with the psychological and human ramifications of war.The hero is Robert Jordan, an American idealist fighting in Spain on the side of the `Republic,' or Communist, party. Opposite the `Reds' are the so-called fascists. At the beginning, Jordan has an unflinching and unwavering duty to the cause, but the people he meets and a girl he falls in love with alter somewhat his outlook. The bulk of the novel deals with Jordan's own philosophy, but also with the philosophy of the band of guerillas he is assigned to complete a mission with. Through his love for the girl, Maria, and his interaction with the scheming rebel leader Pablo and his wife Pilar, Jordan learns much about life and war.The plot moves quickly enough, and all leads up to the final climactic battle at the bridge. This is perhaps Hemingway's finest moment, and his treatment of the battle and fate of the group is nothing short of masterful. The quote from John Donne ""never send to know for whom the bell tolls"" looms ominously throughout the novel, and the battle of the bridge and the final, chilling moment of truth for Robert Jordan drives home the harrowing fact that is the reality of war: ""it tolls for thee."""

The story opens with a brutalmurder that takes place amidst the buzz of the annual festival. From there,we go on an extended flashback that describes how the original 100 settlers(a sampling of the world's brightest, if not necessarily most stable minds)first colonized Mars. Summarizing their training, we get to know many ofthe personalities intimately on the long voyage out, and as the initialsettlement is established. Like Faulkner, Robinson changes the point ofview with each section to give a variety of viewpoints on what was done andwhy, allowing the reader to decide who is right and who is wrong. Returningto the present, we see the fruits of their labors: several domed cities,thousands of residents, a working space elevator (based on the Arthur C.Clarke design), and a radical genetic treatment that will vastly alter whatit means to be human. But there are dangers present as well, and theresulting catastrophe makes for an unforgettable climax to a masterfullytold story.There's a lot to love about this book: the painstakingly detaileddescriptions of the Martian landscape, the attendant environmental concerns,the even more pressing psychosocial problems, the mysteries of the stowawayand the lost colony and the assassination all work together to form a Marsthat is more alive than any other. The powerful personalities at play inthis story, and their failure to come to terms with the greater issues atstake, set this book apart from everything else in the field.

6,3.07,0.9939,1997,11-19,4947500,Lord Stanley,San Francisco,USD 31.00 - USD 50.00,California,East,5,"This beautifully written book is often compelling and occasionally trying. At nearly 500 densely written pages, I found my edition of the book perhaps overly long, but nonetheless admirable. It is the story of an American named Robert Jordan who fights in the mountains outside Madrid during the Spanish Civil War.I read the book at least once when I was young, but that was at least thirty years ago. Upon picking it up again I found I remembered little except that the earth moved, and that something went amiss during the final scene. I perhaps also remembered, at least faintly, an extraordinary tale told by a character named Pilar about the fate of the fascist in a Spanish village.Hemingway makes it abundantly clear that he wants to write a true book. By this, I think he means that he wants to tell us the truth about the people who fought in the Spanish Civil War, and in that goal I believe he succeeds. After reading the book, I feel a little as though I was actually there, a combatant in the war, and that I knew others who fought beside me. This is small ""t"" truth, synonymous with words such as realistic, or factual. Hemingway was not trying to tell the Truth about God.Refusing to romanticize the soldiers who fought for the Spanish Republic, he tells us what is good about them, and what is bad. It is possible, though unlikely, that I could write truthfully about the kind of highly educated Americans who I lived with most of my life. But I could never write so vividly, or so convincingly, about the kind of illiterate, or semi-literate, Spanish townspeople who inhabit this book. One understands exactly why the good guys lost this war, and yet somehow one loves these struggling, obscene, dirty people all the more for their faults.There are several obvious accomplishments in this book. One is the amazing character Pilar, a woman in her late forties or early fifties who comes vividly to life as complex, frequently contradictory character who is simultaneously admirable and intolerable. The description of the fascists being slaughtered in a small town by the drunken Pablo is perhaps one of the better passages in all of Hemingway. Another description of a fight on a hill is impossible to put down, and of course no one is ever going to forget the scene when the earth moves, or the beautiful language that adorns nearly every page of this book.After reading this book, I read Of Mice and Men and then picked up Typhoon, two beautifully written books which are perhaps significantly better than For Whom the Bell Tolls. Yet neither Conrad nor Steinbeck writes as beautifully, as lyrically, or as movingly as Hemingway at his best. It is odd, perhaps even ironic, that a man so obsessed with violence and manly courage should have such a lovely, moving prose style. Hemingway inhabited the English language with an ease and skill, that even at this stage in his career, produced prose that rates as one of the glories of the English language. Some of the descriptions of nature in this book are among the finest I've ever read, particularly when Hemingway turned his attention to pine trees!Hemingway's openly admitted love of violence mars this book, as do several long meditative passages about the vagaries of life, or the character of the rebel soldiers who fought with the Robert Jordan. To his credit, Hemingway's main character finally concedes that though violence is compelling, it is nevertheless evil. It is even possible that Hemingway loved not so much manly strength, as the ability to survive without giving in to the fear that can destroy a man's character, and lead him to let down not only himself, but those who work beside him. Fear must have been a torture to Hemingway, sending him into wild fits of depression and chaotic ruminations. He loved, and wrote beautifully about, those times when one feels calm, and brave, and settled. I'm not sure one really needs to face down a bull in order to achieve such a state, but I have sympathy for Hemingway's goals, if not his means.A true description about an historical event like the Spanish Civil War is a wonderful gift to bring to a reader, and one to savor and enjoy. And at the heart of the book are two characters, Robert Jordan and Maria, who are tough and admirable. Though I think some of my feminist friends would criticize me for it, I nevertheless found Maria believable, and I think that there are young women in this world who are as innocent, good and true as Maria. If there are really people in this world like Robert Jordan, I've never met them, but I suppose it is unfair to fault Hemingway for creating such an admirable hero.I should confess that I didn't really want to like this book, mostly because I don't always care for the tone adopted by so many of the people who most passionately admire Hemingway when they begin singing the praises of their hero. But though I found the going tedious at times, nevertheless I was won over by this flawed book. Somehow the lives of the poor Spaniards who lived in the hills of Spain and fought the fascists seem more real, and more worthwhile, than the lives that most of us in America live today. We are many times more sophisticated, but perhaps not quite as likable, and I have to admire Hemingway for bringing these people to life so vividly, and in such beautiful prose. It must have been extraordinary to know and work beside people who fought to bravely for such a worthy cause."

I was really excited about reading it, I know it's a bestseller and that I was probably going to like it. I admit, the real reason that made me curious about this story was that Jacob, the protagonist, is a veterinarian, like me.Jacob is a young man who is about to end his studies, when life gives him an awful surprise. His parents are dead, and he is left with nothing. Running from his old life, he jumps into the train of a circus called The Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth. He is saved from being hurled out of the train only because he's a veterinarian. The circus have a lot of animals, and they need to be taken care of.Jacob is young, innocent and a veterinarian with a big love for animals. Taking care of the animals makes him happy, and that is how he met Marlena. Beautiful, fragile, but married.I really liked this book. I loved how the author described life at the circus. It's obvious she investigated about circus, the people who worked at them, how they function, and their animals.But what I liked more was the writing. The story is told by old Jacob. He's 90 years old, or 93, and his memories about the circus, his wife and his life don't die. He starts narrating the story, but suddenly you realize you are reading young Jacob while being at the circus.Overall, Water for Elephants was a book that grabbed me from the beginning. Although I wanted more emotion between Marlena and Jacob, it's a romantic story, full of action, love for animals and a magnificent circus."

But what I got was like mother's milk, (another favorite,) for those of us who longed for a return to a world we loved and characters that we missed.Longsuffering fans of the series (and I count myself among them,) have been reading this series since the first book A Game of Thrones was published in 1996. The most recent book prior to this one, A Feast for Crows, was published in 2005 and that novel is actually only half of A Dance with Dragons. But not the normal half, where the first portion chronologically is separated into part one and then the second half, or what happens next, is put into part two. A Dance with Dragons is actually like Martin took a loaf of bread and sliced it long-ways, making the whole story only coherent when you shuffle A Dance with Dragons together with A Feast for Crows like a deck of cards. The last full book, meaning all the characters working through a continuous timeline, was published in 2000. That means that for the last 11 years, fans of this series have been waiting for updates on some of these characters. It was not worth the wait.For the last 11 years we've wondered what happened to Daenerys Targaryen, Jon Snow, and others and the answers given in this book were less than satisfactory. In fact, it had been so long, that I had to be reminded who some of these characters were for the story to make sense (and in fact, the excellent HBO production of A Game of Thrones was instrumental in helping me remember.) I see no way that this series can possibly conclude in only two more books because almost nothing happens! How can we read nearly 1000 pages and there be so little movement?Martin has been called the American version of J.R.R. Tolkein. That is most certainly not true! Not just because of the timeliness issues, but rather the fact that there is nearly complete moral ambiguity in these novels. At no time are readers clear about who is right or wrong, who is evil or good, and there is no one to cheer for that actually survives any given book. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings had no such issue. Tolkien made it very clear who were on the side of good and who weren't. He also made clear that individual choices had consequences and actions like courage, loyalty and truth were to be encouraged and greed, lust and dishonesty were to be discouraged. Martin conveys no clear moral compass. And this is a looming failure for this series: will we even care who wins the Iron Throne in the end?The books may seem more like a very, very short ride after a long, long line at an amusement park, but those of us who made the mistake of reading the incredible first three books have no choice but to continue to wait for the series conclusion, frustrated, but hopeful.Roy Dotrice, was a complete failure in the unabridged audiobook version, which is what this review is based upon. From the first chapter I wondered whether I would be able to stomach the gruff, growling voices that made nearly every character - male or female - sound like they were angry Irish dwarves. He was great for the narration, but the voices were a huge distraction. And it may be because the book was 959 pages long, but there were a multitude of uncorrected errors by Dotrice as he would read and realize a moment later that he was doing the wrong voice and switch. Most audiobooks get edited to fix these, so I assume the non-corrections are due to length. Finally, on the audiobook, Martin may not be a good candidate for audio regardless of reader because of his reliance on characters and inner-thought in his narrative, which makes it tough to tell when listening to a reader when the character is thinking and when they are actually speaking.For those of us who have been hooked for years, we had no choice but to devour hungrily - like men starved - this book. But for those of you have not yet started this ride, hold off until or even if Martin finishes this series. Instead look to authors like Brandon Sanderson for excellent fantasy books that actually progress and series that actually end.Review originally published at BookGateway.

The novel seamlessly alternates between two periods of Jacob's life, beginning when he was in his early 20s, having lost everything after the death of his parents (the impetus for his joining the circus) and as an elderly man in a nursing home.I was especially moved by the author's clear respect for older people through her portrayal of Jacob and the other residents of the nursing home. The conversations between Rosemary and Jacob were deeply touching and I loved the way Rosemary gently explained to Jacob why the man might have lied about carrying water for elephants at the circus. Oh, and the ending was just beautiful. I was rooting for Jacob all the way!I was also fascinated by some of the historical bits such as redlighting and Jake Leg, a disease some people got (usually poor people) from drinking Jamaican Ginger Extract during the Prohibition Era.

To understand the beginning situation, one needs to have read &#34;Flash For Freedom,&#34; as the two stories fit seamlessly together. In his desperate striving to stay ahead of the law and various revenge-seekers, and somehow get back to safety in England, our hero winds up in an unusual wagon train heading for California, as part of the 1849 gold rush. His description of the great plains back in what he calls &#34;the earlies&#34; makes you wish you could have ridden beside him, at least through the calmer part of the journey. But you'll be glad not to accompany him racing for his life across the Jornada del Muerto before a squad of outraged Apaches, or escaping with (most of) his hair from the battlefield of the Little Big Horn."

In other words, one does not have to be a science-fiction fan to enjoy it. It explores the human condition and the universe as well, and the relationship of the two, through the eyes of some of the most beautifully developed characters to be found in all of literature. It is both cosmic and very, very human in its scope.While I greatly enjoy SF, Robinson sets the bar higher for a genre that is often too comfortable in its niche. He looks at where we are going, and points to a bright future--one that is possible to achieve if we have the heart to try."

His motives are never discussed, as are not the theater of or the reasons for the war. The novel is rather about several people who, in the course of a few days, are helping Robert Jordan complete his mission: to blow up a bridge.The novel's tall order - being ""involved in Mankinde"" to the extent of fighting thy neighbor's civil wars - is echoed in the story's close engagement with each character. Here is the natural-born killer Pablo, his no-nonsense and wise Gypsy wife Pilar, the beautiful young girl Maria who is carrying much pain, the good old rock of a man Anselmo, who fights to win this war, but who in his bones knows that thou shalt not kill.Robert Jordan is singled out to have both the first and last name. All the other foreigners go by their last names and the Spaniards - by their first ones. Besides embodying the foreign engagement in the Spanish affair, Robert Jordan also brings a distinctly human element into the war zone: the lonely human name among the nomes de guerre of general Golzs and partisan Anselmos.The book is written as if translated from Spanish. The language is a bit choppy, many expressions read like Spanish idioms translated verbatim, some phrases are left in Spanish. This adds to the feeling that one is in a foreign setting. As it often happens in Hemingway's novels, much working of the human spirit is revealed through this simple language."

It remains today, some 60 years later, one of the most watched movies.For many, their first exposure to truly fine literature may well have been a Hemingway novel. Whenever our introduction to this author took place is probably etched in our memories. His stories are related with such impact that they remain with us.And now, with this audio version there is another unforgettable experience available as actor Campbell Scott's narration takes us back to 1937 and the Spanish Civil War. Raised in Boston, Scott still has a touch of that city in his voice, which only adds to its richness. He reads with a steadfastness that pleases the ear and an intimacy that holds listeners.We hear, ""He lay flat on the brown, pine-needled floor of the forest, his chin on his folded arms, and high overhead the wind blew in the tops of the pine trees. The mountainside sloped gently where he lay; but below it was steep and he could see the dark of the oiled road winding through the pass. There was a stream alongside the road and far down the pass he saw a mill beside the stream and the falling water of the dam, white in the summer sunlight.""For many those are familiar words yet they continue to command attention as the story of Robert Jordan, a demolitions expert who has come to blow up a bridge, begins. He hopes to enlist the aid of Pablo in his mission. However, Pablo is more than reluctant, having seen enough of war he just wants to be left alone. Further he wonders what right a foreigner has to tell him what to do.Of course, there is the beautiful Maria with whom Jordan falls in love, and Pablo's wife, Pilar who is still willing to fight for the cause.Many consider this to be one of the greatest books to be found in American literature.

5,3.12,0.9919,2006,10-17,6752900,Shouk,Washington,,UCLA,West,2,"Through all the slurry of racism and sludge of curmudgeonly conservatism in the Flashman books, of which I've previously reviewed five, there have been two shining qualities that have kept me reading. First is the galloping humor, the sharp satire of almost everything sacred. Second is the historicism, the assurance that within the fiction there is a core of pertinent historical scholarship. Unfortunately, in ""Flashman and the Redskins"" the humor is less than fresh, and the scholarship is dismal. In fact, the only part of the book worth reading is the first section, in New Orleans, where Flash's scoundrely luck holds true. The wagon train journey that delivers Flash to Santa Fe wallows deeper than buffalo droppings in inaccurate geography and ludicrous descriptions of trail events. The fleeting appearances of ""Redskins"" along the trail do not have the accuracy, or the ring of accuracy, of Fraser's writing about Pathans and other peoples of the Raj. I can think of two possible reasons, both irritating: 1) Fraser is just as inaccurate about the Pathans and such, but I don't know enough to catch him at it, or 2) Fraser doesn't suppose that conditions in America require the same level of research that conditions in the British Empire require.In any case, I'm gonna stall on reading any more of the series for a couple of years, or decades. It's getting repetitive. Besides, various commentators on my earlier reviews have assured me that Fraser really did mean much of the nonsense Flashman spouts, that Fraser was as much an insular chauvinist as Paul Goodman, that he sincerely believed the British Empire was largely a boon to the dusky races sunk in their age-old lethargy, that if only the White Man had Borne his Burden long enough the world would now be nigh unto paradise. The implication, my friends, is that enthusiastic readers of the Flashman books are getting their jollies from deriding colored people, demeaning women, and in general escaping the self-censorship of their vilest thoughts which they reluctantly learned in school and from the ineluctable reality of modern life. Sharing a sneer with my neighborhood racist isn't much fun after all."

What seemed paper-thin and kind of ridiculous to me was ""beautiful and moving"" to nearly everyone else. Everything about this book seemed like a cheat--like the warning you get on a bag of chips--""contents may settle""--to explain how there are only three chips in a family-sized bag. Even the inclusion of the period photographs seemed to excuse the writer for not making clear enough pictures of her own. It's not just the implausibility of the story either (elephant speaks only Polish). If the details are right, I can be drawn into even the most ridiculous of stories (THE RUINS and THE TERROR come to mind)), but the paragraphs here are so flimsy (usually no more than three sentences long) that I never pictured (or believed) a word of it. I'd close the book and pick it up a few hours later and have absolutely no idea what had happened. It was an ""easy read,"" but I don't know many writers who would consider that a compliment."

This is aman who would betray his friends at the drop of ahat, provided that the betrayal it was useful, aman who invented the ""love them and leave them""philosophy, a man who will say or do anything toescape with his own hide.But he is also a man who is destined to be wherethe action is - so in his various adventures, hemeets Abraham Lincoln, is involved in the famouscharge of the light brigade, becomes friends (of asort) with Bismarck. But through his eyes, we seehistory just a bit different.There are seven volumes so far in George Frasier'sseries, but the one I think you'll enjoy best isFlashman and the Redskins. Set in the old West,the novel tells of Flashman's encounters with menlike Will Bill Hickock, Geronomo, Kit Carson,Crazy Horse, and George Custer. The culmination ofhis adventures is the most famous of the Westernbattles - Custer's defeat at the Little Big Horn.But Flashman doesn't spend all his time fightingIndians. He would much rather be in the arms of abeautiful woman. And he succeeds in this endeavor,not once, but several times during the course ofthe novel. First, we meet Susie, the madam of abrothel he happens to encounter on his way west.Of course, he can't remain faithful to her forlong, not with all those other women (the ""sluts""as he calls them) that are so available. Finallyhe must abandon his new ""family"" to continue hisjourney, but that doesn't end his womanizing. Whenhe is captured by the Apaches, he saves his lifeby seducing the chief's daughter! And we don'twant to miss the mysterious Mrs. Candy who takeshim on his last journey west.But the joy of this book is not just the marvelousadventures Flashman has, nor is it the great character Fraserhas created (a man you love to hate). This is a book where thelanguage is equal to the story. As Flashman describes his nearbrushes with death, we can feel his fear, fear that he is ableto cover up when others are around.This is a book that will keep you on the edge of your seat, butyou'd best hold on tight, or you'll fall off laughing.(NOTE: Since one of Flashman's characteristics is his amorousnature, there are several rather ribald passages. They are notpornographic or vulgar, but they are suggestive. I found themquite funny, but if they bother you, just skip a few paragraphsand you'll be in safe territory again.)"

To be honest, I chose this one because I was familiar with the Metallica song that was named after this book.I found this to be one of the most difficult books I have ever read; not because of the style or because I didn't like it but because simply it was just a difficult story to read. The novel is full of strong themes about death and honor. Robert Jordan, the main character, is a man who does not get caught up in any causes or seems to hold any passionate views. Through the whole book he questions his beliefs in the socialist cause; his only concern seems to be defeating the fascists. All of this changes when he meets Maria. The two fall for each other immediately and suddenly Jordan is confronted with the real prospect of the fact that he will not survive his mission.What made this story so difficult to read was that Hemmingway comes across as a nihilist in the writing of this story. His characters are completely controlled by fate and feel powerless to stop the events that are put into place. It seems as if Jordan would have been better off had he not met Maria and cared about her.Overall, the story is very good. I would highly recommend it anyone."

A couple of years ago I found a tattered paperback in a second hand bookstore and enjoyed reading it again. About the same time cable TV screened the mini-series over a week and I was enthralled again.This book, and the sequel War and Remembrance, are Wouk's largest fictional works and give a comprehensive coverage of many of the major events before and during WWII. The Winds of War tells the story of the lead up to WWII through the eyes of Navy Commander Victor ""Pug"" Henry who is appointed Naval Attache in Berlin 6 month's before Hitler's invasion of Poland in September 1939. He travels widely throughout Europe as President Roosevelt's unofficial eyes and ears in Europe, meeting most of the key players during those tumultuous times. During this time Pug begins a platonic but very close and borderline romantic relationship with Pamela Tudsbury, daughter of a famous British radio personality.This book and War and Remembrance are classic novels about WWII. Wouk devoted ""thirteen years of extraordinary research and long, arduous composition"" to these two memorable novels.Since moving to Kindle format I am slowly gathering copies of my favourite books for my Modern Classics Kindle Library. This book certainly gets a place in that library and I am waiting for better pricing before adding War and Remembrance. Last week I added all 6 volumes of Churchill's memoirs of the war to this library when they were a Kindle Daily Deal for $1.99. The world of the Kindle really is a marvellous place.I also enjoyed Wouk's 1990's books, ""The Power"" and ""The Glory"", about the establishment of Israel and the 1967 Six Day War and the 1973 Yom Kippur War. After that I assumed that Wouk had retired but was astounded to find that, at the age of 97, he will publish a new novel in November,The Lawgiver, about the life of Moses.

Forced into marriage the next morning to salvage her reputation, she gradually begins to trust the tenderness and respect with which her noble husband eventually wins her.The period detail and writing literally draw you into the story, weaving a lush tapestry against which the splendid romance between the strong heroine and the persistent hero unfolds beautifully. Red Adam is not only patient and kind as he endeavors to win Julitta's affections, but he is strong and intelligent, recognizing in Julitta an equal, worthy partner and giving her full control of the household whenever he must ride out. Facing impudent serving wenches, a resentful chatelaine, an insolent comrade of Red Adam's, and even a thieving cook, Julitta has her hands full with the running of the estate and all its inherent problems, not to mention the whisper of mystery surrounding the former lord. Throw into that brew political unrest and rebellion, raiding Scotts, betrayal and breathtaking escape, and you have a truly dynamic, potent tale.There is just so much more to the story than the above. A true bond between the characters, genuine affection, and several subplots, all threads being masterfully combined. Any summary is inadequate. But if you like adventure, a mystery interwoven throughout, compelling history that draws you into its pages, true love in the truest sense, and blazing triumph over adversity, then this is your book! I don't know why no one will republish it!"

I read this book for my book club, otherwise it is unlikely I would have picked it up considering my backlog.Personally I didn't find anything wow-ish or over the top astounding with this story. Besides that it takes place in a circus. It had its moments of course, which makes me think that what really makes you like a book is not sometimes the overall story, but a couple of scenes that really stand out. And this had a handful of those, especially those set in the present time, which were the only ones to actually pull my emotional strings, which usually doesn't take much I'm afraid, and considering that this book didn't stir much in me overall. Not even the traditional `big twist' scene riled me up. I actually read a paragraph past it then did a double take on `oh that was suppose to be it'."

It was one of my most favorite reads to date, and I read alot of books! I loved how the book started in the nursing home with the older Jacob and how he reveiled how it felt to be old and most of the time forgotten. His family viewed it as a duty to go and visit him..And then it switches to a young Jacob and tells the story of his adventures working in a circus. For anyone who wanted to run away to the circus as a child, you will definately love this book. I could not put it down. It is exciting one minute and has you on the edge of your seat and the next it is endearing and makes you feel like you really know the characters. I give this book 5 stars and if you want a really good read, you will do the same."

The voice remains true and believable throughout the entire narrative and is well developed giving me a clear picture of who Jacob Jankowski is and why I should care. Because this is achieved, I am fully invested in his world and experiences. Like wise, the supporting characters are dynamic and interesting, but even given their deformities, whether physical or psychologically, they never over shadow the main character.The book provokes thoughts on treatment and intelligence of animals, economy, marriage, class, race, healthcare, friendship and family. As well as, it forces us to take a hard look at how our culture deals with the elderly.""Sometimes the monotony of bingo and sing-alongs and ancient dusty people parked in the hallway in wheelchairs makes me long for death. Particularly when I remember that I'm one of the ancient dusty people, filed away like some worthless tchotchke.""If I had to give a 'con' to the book, it would be toward the ending when the author simplifies Jacob's journey with a 'run away with the circus' solution. However, this does not disappoint and in a way is the logical path and most appropriate ending given the character's circumstances and alternative. It is the happiest it can get."

Martin's A Game of Thrones 5-Book Boxed Set (Song of Ice and Fire Series): A Game of Thrones, A Clash of Kings, A Storm of Swords, A Feast for Crows, and A Dance with Dragons- much easier to hold my Kindle Fire HDX than these 1,000+ page books.This offering was better than book four - A FEAST FOR CROWS - but still left a lot to be desired. My favorite characters (at least most of them) were back in this book but the story stalled. This book is OVER a thousand pages long and I felt that at least half of that was filler.Lots of attention to detail but very little character development in this book. I read the whole thing. All five door stopper books. After all, I loved the first three books in the series. But books four and five have soured me on the Song of Ice and Fire experience. I'm more than a bit leery about reading books six and seven when they come out. I know that I will - I have to find out what happens to my favorite characters (at least the ones that don't get killed off right away). GRRM is quite the hatchet man author.

I am disappointed in the reviews that say the characters are too far fetched and the romance was unrealistic. Its a fictional novel that explores a vet-school drop out, Jacob, who joins a circus by chance and falls in love. The story he tells about life in the circus was thrilling and had me wanting to read more.When the chapters skip back to elderly Jacob, we see how he has gone through a lot in his early lives. I love that he lives at an assisted living and tells his view of his life.The ending made me so happy and I couldn't stop smiling. WELL worth it.

I have yet to find a book that I can compare it to. I suppose I could at least explain why I find this book to be so unique.First of all this book covers most all of life's complex issues in the simplest fashion, and in that respect it is uncanny in presentation. Secondly and astonishingly the author portrays a story of a prophet speaking to his people, but I cannot be so shallow to think that I am reading a said story... I am not reading the said story--what is actually happening is that I am the listener and Kahlil Gibran is the prophet himself. I strongly feel that if you the reader do not come away with this feeling yourself, you are probably reading some other book.I think what would do justice in this review is to explain some feelings you may get from a brief reading, in fact with that said, I can state with confidence that many readers will peruse only a few pages at a time because the content is overwhelming in its ability to provoke thought and feeling. You may feel at times that some all important life questions are being answered. You may feel regret like I did, I regret not having this book earlier in life to help me. I believe that a great many of you will feel amazed. It is truly amazing how such a short simple book can have such a profound impact on a person searching for answers to life's puzzles.There is a quote from the ""Urantia Book"" that is appropriate in closing this review. The quote helps to sum up one of the unexpected feelings I received from this incredible story, and that quote is.. ""The argumentative defense of any proposition is inversely proportional to the truth contained."" ...and I give this quote because this book gives you the feeling that you are reading divine truth. I am a firm believer that if Kahlil Gibran is not a modern day prophet, no one is, and you too may come away with this belief because this is a story that really speaks to the heart of humanity. I cannot think of anyone who would not love this book."

In our book club we chose to read Master Georgie.This was a great disappointment. We should have asked for advice on what books to read. The book was nominated for the Booker prize in 1998, but did not win the award.While there is an interesting historical episode as the background, and there were different viewpoints, the reader never feels that this is a book that must be read. At times it seemed disjointed. There were narratives from different characters, but that style did not feel the gaps. Different narratives normally means the reader gets an insight into an event from different perspectives. This did not happen.So need to read other books to appreciate the greatness of Beryl Bainbridge"

I was afraid it was going to be about animal abuse and very sad. Well - there is that, but it's so much more than that. You'll be transported to a different time and a location most of us will never experience - the backdoor view of a circus. Each character is so real, I felt I could regonize them. And although I wasn't even around when the story took place - at least the early part, I could picture everything right down to the smells and sounds! The author has a terrific grasp of aging as well. Sympathetic but not syrupy. The aged Jacob is quite a character as he struggles with the indignities associated with 'assisted' living and the recollections of a past - recollections that he was just now ready to reveal at age 90 or was that 93?"

I am happy to say, that today, I am well acquainted with his work. The Prophet was the first book I read written by Gibran, and ever since that first reading I have immersed myself in his extraordinarily consummate skill of exquisitely crafted words. To say the Prophet or any other writings by Kahlil Gibran is simply fine literature is to say the mysterious of the soul are mediocre. I recommend that if you have not touched upon any of Kahlil Gibran's books, that you consider the Prophet as a good start. You will not be disappointed. A few other extraordinary works of art by Gibran: The Voice Of The Master; The Beloved; Sand And Foam; The Broken Wings; Between Night And Morn; The Earth Gods; and one of my personal favorites, though not so much a ""story,"" but rather a collection of personal letters to dearly beloved friends: Kahlil Gibran: A Self-Portrait."

Grania has been deaf since the age of five, and Itani opens her inner world to the reader, using Grania's voice to tell the story and gracefully conveying her deafness as part of her selfhood, not as a handicap. Using short sentences of twelve to fifteen words when Grania is a young child trying to figure out her world, Itani begins the story in a simple subject-verb-object pattern, using no complicated clauses or involved syntax, which Grania herself would be incapable of using. When Grania becomes fluent in sign language and lip-reading, the sentence structure becomes more complex. By the time she marries Jim, a hearing man, sentences and syntax are fully developed, and Grania's ability to recognize ambiguity, to see relationships between events, and to respond fully to a hearing world are obvious in her &quot;voice.&quot;The point of view alternates between Grania and Jim, once Jim goes off to war, and important themes--war and peace, life and death, love and friendship, and strength and dependence--weave and develop throughout their contrasting worlds, Grania at home and Jim at the front in Belgium. Itani develops these age-old themes in new ways, sensitively incorporating them with the imagery of sounds and silence, sight and shadows, action and inaction, images we have come to associate with the life Grania and Jim share. In Jim's traumatic world, sound becomes overwhelming: pounding guns, explosions, screams of agony from wounded soldiers. As a result of his life with Grania, however, he is also acutely sensitive to what he sees, discovering, ironically, that it is the hands of the dead and dying that communicate most vividly because they &quot;revealed the final argument: clenched in anger, relaxed in acquiescence, seized in a posture of surprise or forgiveness.&quot;The subordinate characters further flesh out the themes. The friendship and interdependence of Jim and Irish, his best friend parallel the love and support Grania has received from her sister, her remarkable grandmother, and her deaf friends. Grania gains strength through them and is able to give support and strength to others when they need her, just as Jim gains strength from his relationship with Irish and continues to rescue the wounded and dying. As the reader comes to know Grania and Jim and the love they feel for each other, Grania's silent but active world becomes more and more understandable to the reader. Ultimately, the reader has to agree with Grania when she declares, ironically, &quot;Sound is always more important to the hearing.&quot; Mary Whipple"

I love how the author melds the geriatric version of Jacob and the younger version so well. The narrator is in constant reflection and delves deep into the emotional states of almost all involved, including that of the animals. As the geriatric version of Jacob looks into the mirror, he can no longer recognize any part of himself. He tries to look beneath the sagging skin and bruising and still nothing. This lets us know what he is really missing and that it is what a person does, that defines them. If you can no longer do the things you love, then who are you? As Jacob finally realizes what he really needs, we can more clearly see throughout his entire struggle, what kept him so drawn in and how relationships with strangers can be stronger than that of family.

This is perhaps the most extraordinary novel I've read in literally years, from an author with truly AWESOME talent. Generally, I read almost nothing but mystery novels...and ones with ""hard-bitten"" heroes, at that...not even a hint of anything sniveling. I'm just not a touchie-feelie kind of girl. So if a feel-good book like this can affect me so enormously, just think what it'll do for those of you who like this kind of stuff! Only partly joking here; but truly, this is one magnificent work of literary art. Inside glimpses of life in a 1930's circus are so intimately written and ring so true, that it's hard to believe Ms. Gruen isn't 90 years old, writing memoirs. Each character is so artfully rendered that you care, and care deeply!, about every single one of them. You love them or hate them, with equal measures of intensity. Add the super special treat at the beginning of most chapters of real photos from these old circuses, and you have just a jewel of a book. Obviously, I'm drooling all over myself in this review, but I can't recommend it strongly enough, to everyone, no matter your preferences in reading material. I took a chance and am SO glad I did. Oh, and Ms. Gruen has a sense of humor too! There are parts of the book where I guarantee you will be unable to hold back from a big belly laugh, right out loud. Please, get this book. You will NOT regret a single minute of reading time. I fully intend to go now and buy every book she's every written, hoping for another glimpse of her genius."

Water for Elephants tells the story of life after tragedy, when Jacob Jankowski is accidentally thrust into a chaotic circus whirlwind. He discovers the truth about life on a circus for both the performers and workers but more importantly the circus animals. A veterinary major at Cornell university drop out, Jacob needed a break from the world that had plummeted toward him at a thousand miles an hour. Leaving him with not a cent, not a family member, and no certain future.This 5 star book opened the eyes of many across the world to the condition of a circus life in the early 1900's, and how this life could go spinning out of control at any given moment. Each page rich with love, hate, and jealousy, Sara Gruen creates a masterpiece of twists and turns aboard the `Flying Squadron' with the `Benzini Brothers most Spectacular Show on Earth'.

Her writing leaves you hanging on every word, and her distinct characters introduced throughout the story never expose their comfortable selves among the dishonest businesses of the circus. Definitely a 5 star novel, I recommend this book to both teenagers and adults as a MUST read book, Water for Elephants truly makes a difference.-kd"

An elderly man, now in a nursing home, looks back on his time spent as a veterinarian in a circus. It's a story that could have been capable of more, but the plot seemed fairly predictable and the characters not that believable or rounded. It wasn't bad, mind you, I guess you could say this elephant was just too watered down."

The meticulous research on the book results in an interesting panorama of circus life where class divisions (i.e., performers don't sit with the roustabouts, clowns don't share their train car with others, etc.) eventually lead to internecine warfare at the end of the book. There is also jealousy, a three-way love triangle, prohibition, and oh yes, animal husbandry and abuse. The picture the book paints of a prohibition-era circus train is vivid: smuggled moonshine from Canada, various misfits that magically come together during under the big top, the behind-the-barn striptease shows that went on in such circuses (funny, no one told me about that part when I was a kid reading about circus books!) The namesake of the book is Rosie, the elephant that apparently only understands Polish. Until that little nugget is unearthed, Rosie regularly receives the brutal end of a bullhook. The only person between the bullhook and Rosie is the protagonist, Jacob Jankowski, who suddenly finds himself ripped from an Ivy League university to a circus train when his parents die in an accident. Fortunately, Jacob was studying to be a veterinarian and was only one examination shy of a degree. But that does not matter to Uncle Al, the reprehensible circus owner who never saw the back of a head he could not hit. The book has a 98-year old Jacob in contemporary settings reminiscing about his early life in the circus. Jacob's ""escape"" back to a circus towards the end was a bit preposterous, I must admit. But besides that, the book makes for a very interesting reading."

6,3.03,0.9996,1989,03-16,5471900,,San Francisco,$$,Middle Tennessee St,Southeast,13,"War drags on in the Seven Kingdoms. The earlier major players are now largely dead, but their children and heirs battle on. In the north, Jon Snow is now commander of the black watch along the wall. In the trading cities of the south, Daenerys rules over theformer slave city of Meereen--and the natives are restive. Although she speaks of seizing her native kingdom, Daenerys knows that the slavers would return if she leaves, and cannot abandon her adoptive children. So, the world beats a path to Daenerys as every second son, exile, and wanna-be power on the outs makes the voyage to the woman who mothered dragons, and who has a claim to be rightful ruler of the seven kingdoms.George R. R. Martin's epic series A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE was eye-opening and genre-stretching. I remember reading A GAME OF THRONES practically breathless. Every plot twist (and boy did the plot twist) caught me by surprise. Every character I grew to love seemed set up to fail. Martin's strong writing continues, and he has the knack of writing characters complex enough that we care about them, seeing each one as hero of his (or her) own story. Even Queen Cersei--an adulterer, incest participant, and murderer, becomes sympathetic. Here, though, in the fifth book in the series, the characters seem smaller and more focussed on every-day details.Again, I think Martin does fantasy a favor by adding not only the blood and dirt, but also the reality of war and occupation. Victory is not a matter of marching armies through town in a parade, it's sullen opposition, sneak attacks, and worrying whether your allies have betrayed you (or if your dragons have been eating your peoples' children). Managing a rag-tag force on the distant border isn't all about battling giants, it's watching larders empty and worrying about starvation. That being said, we get a LOT of that kind of detail in a book that stretches for 959 pages (not including the lists of characters).One of the key dangers in writing series is that authors find the need to move characters from point to point. That, to a large extent, is what is happening in A DANCE WITH DRAGONS. Tyrion is traveling to meet Daenerys--but doesn't quite get there. Stannis Baratheon is traveling toward Winterfell--but doesn't quite get there. Several suitors are trying to get to Daenerys--but mostly don't get there. Arya is learning to be invisible and to be an assassin--and actually makes progress. Ultimately, I appreciate what Martin is doing and I think he's adding key elements to a genre that has, to a large extent, offered its readers easy blacks and whites, simple solutions to complex problems. But I wanted to see more happen. Fans of this series could, I fear, skip the entire 959 pages and pick up the next volume without having to scratch their heads and wonder what has changed. The answer, to a large extent, is not much.Okay, I'm a fan of Martin's. Martin continues to be an effective wordsmith, continues to create a wonderfully complex world, continues to frustrate (and reward) his readers by refusing to let his characters find simplistic solutions to the problems they face. Overall, fans of this series (like me) will want to read A DANCE WITH DRAGONS. There's enough here to entertain and fascinate--but I do think it could have moved a bit faster."

It's not your typical early Hemingway, and that's not a negative critic. The book is emotional, some passages are just really impressive. I think it's the one I preferred of all the books by Ernie that I read.One thing that makes this book special is the direct speeches. If you read this book you will not fail to notice a certain touch of 17th century in the way people speak to each other. I thought I would explain the reason for this as it is not self-explanatory for people who are native english-speakers. Spanish is a language where you have two forms of second person, ""you""; as in french, and formerly English. This is the difference between the ""you"" and the ""thou"", which is used in this novel. Formerly, the ""you"" was the polite form, and the ""thou"" the familiar form (not the religious form as many might think since the only use where you actually hear it anymore is for religious stuff). So whenever you see ""thou"" being used in the novel you know it means familiarity, as in old english. If I remember correctly, Hemingway also uses turns of phrases in such a way that it makes them sound ""latin"", the way it would be done in Spanish, which is the goal. This is a bit weird I have to admit but you'll get used to it, just keep in mind it's used to approach more closely the reality of the Spanish language, and thus have a better ""translation"".Worth reading."

In his best piece, Old Man and the Sea, Hemingway describes a man's courage and conviction in a mini-epic struggle between and elderly man and the greatest catch of his life (a giant marlin). In another book, The Sun also Rises, Hemingway paints a very rich and colorful portraitt of Spain and Pamplona that I could not sum up in a few sentences. Both books create a vivid picture almost unequaled in literature.This book, however, does nothing of the sort. Excluding a side story that concerns the massacre of a town of locals, it is repetitive, boring, and provides little insight. The majority of this 450 page book takes place in one cave and provides very little substance. Personally, no picture was painted for me, no human character was exposed, and no real lasting meaning came from this book.I grew tired of the cave, tired of the speculation about killing the Guerilla leader Pablo, and bored of the lightweight, unreal romance. An editor could have spliced away pages 200-400, and the book would have not missed a beat.If you're a casual reader like myself, stick with other Hemingway works."

What sets Water for Elephants apart is not only the incredible quantity and quality of research that went into it, but the way Gruen employs her pool of researched knowledge to craft her plot, characters and milieu.In lesser hands, a story or book that relies on heavy research can hit the reader over the head with it, to the detriment of concentration and enjoyment. Long explanatory paragraphs; tedious but unnecessary details; the sacrificing of the Big Picture to sideshows--these are sins that are distressingly common in historical novels. It's like the author has taken all this trouble; you've got to see what he dug up, like it or not.In Gruen's case, not one detail is out of place. Not one fact is gratuitous. Everything fits; everything moves the plot along or enhances the characters. The picture develops fully, in living color, without clutter; the settings are so true, you can smell the young hobos and their fire and touch the sweat on the horses. The most unbelievable bit is believable, because you trust Gruen as a storyteller. She is that good a writer.I hate to review a book when so many have, and god knows my opinion won't make a whit's difference in the sales of this book or its success. But it was just so good, I felt compelled to weigh in.

I love sci-fi and the idea of going to Mars has always fascinated me.So needless to say I was a bit disappointed to find that reading Red Mars was about as interesting as watching paint dry. No, let me take that back...watching paint dry is more interesting.The book is two things: a character study and a detailed (painfully detailed) description of Mars itself.As for the character study: Different sections focus on a particular character and provide a view from inside that character's head, so to speak. The problem is that the characters aren't particularly interesting, putting a damper on the whole notion of ""character study.""As for a plot, well, there isn't much of one to speak of. Oh, there's a kind of overall direction of events, but nothing that one would confuse for an actual plot, heavans no.This must have been intentional and part of the artsy-fartsy idea the writer had when conceiving this book as I know that just about every first year writing student understands the idea of plotting.Oh wellAlong with this we get page after page of lovingly detailed exposition on Mars itself.Now, I find Mars fascinating. Just looking at the NASA lander pictures gives me chills. So trust me when I say that the reams of paper devoted to describing the planet gets gets old fast. You will get hundreds of pages describing just about every nook and cranny of Mars. I really can't imagine anyone finding this much detail interesting, unless one is a gelologist, naw...I don't think that I will continue on with the series at this point."

After the death of his parents he jumps a freight train only to discover it is a circus train. He was one exam away from becoming a veterinarian at the time of his families death and his time with the circus not only helped form his view of the world but also his view of mankind and himself. It was moving, the characters were 3 dimensional and grew during the telling of this tale. I couldn't put it down. The ending was very unexpected and I found myself wondering when it was all said and done what happened next. Although this was not in a genre I normally read I would highly recommend it. I am an animal lover and his compassion for the beast that were used by the circus was very touching. I found myself routing for the good guys and hating the bad guys and thinking to myself I could so see myself doing that. There are things that happen in everyone's life that shape them, change them and help them become the people they are meant to be. This story will touch your heart and make think back over your own life with new perspective. I give it two thumbs up a must read for anyone who has ever loved and lost or who has wondered what if?

I suppose a whole book devoted to a nursing home soap opera would have been too much, so the circus story paced it out.I found myself skimming the chapters about the circus so I could get back to the nursing home drama.

7,3.42,0.99402,2011,01-18,7892000,Urban Garden,Los Angeles,$$,Butler,Final Four,8,"Water for ElephantsBy Sara GruenIn the experience of this reviewer romantic books of any kind are generally written for those with a sentimental heart, and a genre that I try to avoid. Who doesn't like a good love story now and again, but the modern romantic drama or comedy seems to be written for a specific audience. Without trying to be presumptuous or overly sexist modern romances are a genre mainly written by women for women. So when Water for Elephants was suggested and then selected to be read by the Super Cool Facebook Readers Club I assumed it was a book that was written for the opposite sex and one I would find hard to enjoy. But as it is warned so often not to make assumptions and hardly ever heeded, I found that my assumptions about Water for Elephants were incorrect. Water for Elephants by Sara Gruen, a bestselling author and book is a romantic drama that can be enjoyed by all readers.Water for Elephants is a story about an aged man, Jacob Jankowski who we discover in a nursing home and through his memories we are taken on a dark and romantic journey to his youth as a veterinarian in a traveling circus. Jacobs past comes rushing to the front of his mind when a circus arrives and sets up next to the nursing home he resides in. In Water for Elephants the reader gets to experience a forbidden love between Jacob and one of the star performers of the Benzini Brothers circus, Marlena. The whirl wind romance between Jacob and Marlena is both suicidal and heart melting. The reader also gets a good dose of violence and sexual content as the traveling circus life during the depression era of the 1930's is unfolded for us in dramatic fashion by Sara Gruen in Water for Elephants. Add in an elephant who understands only the Polish language, a masturbating midget and his dog Queenie and an untold number of corrupt acts and you will discover why Water for Elephants is a romantic story that can be enjoyed by just about any one.Although the idea of a nursing home has been used by other authors as the stage for telling a tale about ones past it does not hinder the story. Sara's creative writing abilities and her knowledge about all things circus keep the nursing home in the background of the readers mind until the very end. And if there is anything that could be considered a hindrance to the book it might be the end itself. The end of the story, where Jacob, 90 years young rides off into the sunset with the traveling circus that was set up next to his nursing home, creates more questions than can be answered by the novel.All things considered Water for Elephants is a well written novel by Sara Gruen. The work of literature has the ability to capture the attention of both men and women. Water for Elephants is a unique romantic drama that will capture your attention with heart melting romance, intense episodes of violence, graphically detailed sexual acts and a traveling circus. Water for Elephants is an unforgettable and exciting novel that will have you talking about it long after you have read it.(written on 7/10/2011 by the administrator of the Super Cool Facebook Readers Club, based loosely on the discussions held by the club about the novel Water for Elephants.)"

Based on her review, I purchased the book and it sat on my bookshelf for three years!! I considered reading it several times, but it was always passed over in favor of other novels that sounded more intriguing. Once I started seeing trailers for the movie adaptation of the novel with Reese Witherspoon and Robert Pattinson, I finally extracted the book from its place in the bookshelf and read it. THANK GOODNESS I did! Water for Elephants is a brilliantly written account of a Veterinarian student who loses his parents in a car crash and ends up joining a circus in a chance encounter. The author clearly depicts what circus life was like in the 1930s and builds larger than life circus folk whose personalities bounce off of the novel's pages. I highly recommend Water for Elephants, it's a story of loss, love, animals, circus shenanigans, and betrayal. It's a fun romp with a great ending that you'll thoroughly enjoy."

I was hesitant when I first bought it and wasn't expecting much. I was pleasantly surprised when I dove into it - I couldn't put it down. I've heard a lot of people complain that this falls short of ""real"" circus life - but I can tell you, it's as close as I'm sure you'll ever get in this day and age, unless you talk to someone who worked back then. I can tell you from experience that circuses and carnivals have changed, very very drastically, from their old days. While I can't say I've traveled on a circus, I have grown up on a carnival that has been in my family for decades. The stories passed down from earlier times, the pictures taken, etc tell a very different tale from the modern day carnivals. I'm sure Water for Elephants is the same way. Sara Gruen is a favorite author of mine since I read her horse series years ago. I was sucked into this book from the beginning and was very pleasantly surprised by the way things progressed. There was never a dull moment in the book, though it was easy to guess what was happening next during most of it. It was a surprisingly dark book, but it was done in a way that did not make it terrible to read. The characters were interesting and engaging, though the love between the two main characters seemed rushed and sloppy. I would have rather seen a longer book with more development between them, but I can't complain too much. It was an exciting, though easy, read and I recommend it to anyone who is a fan of romance or simply interested in an old-time circus setting. I only hope the movie turns out as good as this book ( though my hope is not high )."

(I have to admit that I have little to no desire to read about an old man in the sea. Sorry.)In For Whom the Bell Tolls, Robert Jordan is an American supporting the Republic in the Spanish Civil War. Jordan has been given the assignment to work with a small band of guerrillas to blow up a bridge at the moment of the Republic offensive. Over the three days he spends with the guerrillas the reader gets into his head and experiences the physical and psychological experience of being in war.I sat in my car waiting to do a family photo session this morning and finished this fabulous novel. It is powerful and emotional and just confirmed my belief that Hemingway is one of the greatest writers. I'm gushing, I know. He's not for everyone. I've pushed my husband to read both A Farewell to Arms and The Sun Also Rises and he's not a fan. My husband thinks Hemingway is just an angry drunk. He might be right but I'm going to encourage him to give Hemingway another chance and read For Whom the Bell Tolls. I think he will be glad he did."

Most readers (at least those who post reviews) love this book. Everybody who told me to read it (five or six reader friends) guaranteed enjoyment. I like those guarantees. Unfortunately, there's no such thing.Good things about ""Water for Elephants:"" Atmosphere Period detail (a rundown traveling circus from 1931) Old man's voiceNot so good things about ""Water for Elephants:"" Run-of-the-mill imagery. Examples: ""His eyes drill into Marlena. His temple pulses."" ""Flailing my arms like a windmill."" ""I blush so hard my scalp prickles."" (Really?) ""The roustabouts, once roused, run about like headless chickens."" The terrain is as ""dry as a bone."" ""I leave though every bone in my body screams against it."" There's not too much doubt about where the story is going, even from early on. We know Jacob will be successful, despite predictions he won't last a week. Tension is low throughout. Protracted scenes--such as Lucinda's funeral and the long strip-tease scene at the beginning. To what end? Perfect characters--too perfect. The sadistic hothead. The charming circus girl. Etc.In the end, the good things about the book were buried under the weight of the not-so-good.

The terraforming Mars idea has been done many times, and often better. This one, however, is longer.The best part of the series is the specifics of the science, especially in this first book. I agree with others that Robinson seems to run out of decent ideas in his sequels, often killing off characters, including some of the most interesting ones, for seemingly no purpose. Also, there is also a whole semi-immortality thing going on that eventually grows tiresome.BTW, having recently read The Martian Chronicles by Ray Bradbury, I found that to be a far more meaningful work, even though the science itself was preposterous. Bradbury's stories have far more human truth, and are far more literary, than Red Mars and others of its ilk. And they come in at several hundred fewer pages."

The story is set during the 1930's depression and takes place primarily on a traveling circus train. Jacob Jankowski, recently orphaned, is hired as the veterinarian for the circus. Through Jacob's gaze, we are introduced to the inner workings of the greatest show on earth as proclaimed by Uncle Al, owner of the Benzini Brothers circus. We learn of the work required to roll out and pick up a circus as well as the cruelty with which the men charged with this work are treated. While the animals, performances and circus atmosphere are well rendered by the author I found the class structure created within the traveling circus of particular interest; a structure whereby the lowest members of the circus team may be guaranteed a meal but not necessarily a wage or a life. Equally interesting to me is the depiction of geriatric care, familial and professional, afforded Jacob during his twilight years. Gruen did an excellent job of capturing the desolation of aging without the care and proximity of your family.""Water for Elephants"" is a well crafted tale of adventure, love and murder. The characters are memorable and the language easily accessible and imagistic. This is an entertaining read but I must admit it dispelled any quixotic notions that I associate with running off with the circus; that was hard and dangerous work then. You were luck if you left the show with your life and even luckier if you left with a life. For this reader, It'll be enough to watch the next circus that comes to town and remember the men and women that whose hard work made it possible then and keeps the show on the road now. Enjoy!"

What makes it great is the science is believable and the character interactions spot on. This is not a series about bug-eyed monsters and ray guns, this is about humans colonizing Mars and the challenges they will face: technical, environmental, social, and political. I bought a hard back set for myself and lend my well-worn paperback set to friends. I am now reading more of Ms. Robinson's books which is the best recommendation I could give."
7,3.39,0.9906,2007,05-17,6851600,Noble Vegetarian,Sacramento,,Pittsburgh,West,3,"This book does provide a fairly riveting story set within post depression America and also provides good insights into the circus business during this era. The book balances the dynamics of maintaining a circus in tough economic times against a host of vivid and disparate personalities that can both support and challenge the stability of the circus. For example there is Big Al who runs the circus with a nearly ruthless practicality, ""redlighting"" individuals who violate his rules. There is August, second in command, alternately tough and gracious, supportive and cruel. There is Jacob, the hero, who stumbles into the world after fleeing Cornell Vet School and who subsequently falls in love with August's wife. The book alternates between the young Jacob in the circus and the elderly Jacob in a nursing home. Some of the dialogue the characters use during the depression era sounds like it came from the 21st century but other than that there is a gritty, often grotesque and unblinking realism in everything from death to romance."

Glad I bought it and enjoyed reading it.However, at times the author goes from chronicling the views of individual anarchists (and opponents) to coming down on one side or another of a debate. This itself would be useful, except the author seems to give short shrift to views he doesn't share.For example, take Murray Bookchin's criticisms of deep ecology. Marshall simply treats Bookchin's criticisms as untenable and treats Bookchin's disagreements with the deep ecologists as an example of how Bookchin ""laments our alienation from nature ... but he would still appear to be a victim of the process.""Perhaps if the subtitle of ""Demanding the Impossible"" had been ""An Evaluation and Critique of Anarchism"" rather than ""A History of Anarchism"" this wouldn't have been so jarring, but it left me wondering (as someone not overly familiar with anarchist thinking and debates) how much of his history is colored by his own personal views on what is and is not anarchism proper."

I was not disappointed. This is the story of a man who is looking back on his life and how his actions helped him become the man he became. After the death of his parents he jumps a freight train only to discover it is a circus train. He was one exam away from becoming a veterinarian at the time of his families death and his time with the circus not only helped form his view of the world but also his view of mankind and himself. It was moving, the characters were 3 dimensional and grew during the telling of this tale. I couldn't put it down. The ending was very unexpected and I found myself wondering when it was all said and done what happened next. Although this was not in a genre I normally read I would highly recommend it. I am an animal lover and his compassion for the beast that were used by the circus was very touching. I found myself routing for the good guys and hating the bad guys and thinking to myself I could so see myself doing that. There are things that happen in everyone's life that shape them, change them and help them become the people they are meant to be. This story will touch your heart and make think back over your own life with new perspective. I give it two thumbs up a must read for anyone who has ever loved and lost or who has wondered what if? A truly great read."

I know it sounds like it but really there were no epic battle scenes....no crazy weddings....no giant feasts. Just a lot of background info and plot building but a lot of it I found very interesting.This book made me want to know more and more about the background of many of the lesser known characters. For instance...I really want to know more about Lyanna Stark now. What was the true nature of the relationship between her and Rhaegar Targaryen? I also want to know more about Melisandre and her religion....how does it all work? Where do her powers come from? I want to know more about the House of Black and White and the Many-Faced God. With this book I read a lot more on the Ice and Fire Wiki that I have with other books...mostly trying to learn more about some of the other characters and the religions.I was really intrigued by what's happening with Jon Snow and the visions that Melisandre is having about him in the fires. Could he be Azor Ahai and not Stannis? Could Melisandre's visions have been read wrong? There are so many questions surrounding the prophecy, Jon parentage, and Melisandre's visions and I for one am DYING to know more about this storyline.I loved the direction that Bran's character is heading. I think his greenseeing is going to play a huge role in the future of the series. I think through this, a lot of questions will be answered and explained....especially since he can see things that happened in the past.While this book might not have been as action packed as some of the others, it was still the `necessary book'.

Most behave like idiots that would never be chosen to lead an expedition to Mars. Further, the story is, sort of, told in the perspective of the character. But as the story moved through time, all of a sudden you are getting one character's story line to the exclusion of the others. Not attempt is made to integrate the whole story resulting in a very disjointed and impossibly convoluted book. Then there is a half baked attempt to turn this into a political theory discussion, with an incredibly violent revolution about 60% through the book that, effectively destroys everything that had been built in the first part of the book. WTF? The our surviving lead characters become a wandering lost tribe. It just makes no sense.To the author's credit, his description of the Martian landscapes are wonderful.

Immediately was drawn into it and read it in a day. Book is 331 pages and for me it read quickly.My opinion the book is that it is thought provoking and also educational - communicated through the day to day thoughts of a man now facing the day to day realities and drawbacks of living in an ""Assisted Living"" facility.Gruen is able to effectively weave a lot of bittersweet humor into her character and has also imparted quite a bit of history of the period of the Great Depression and also circus life.Read thru the ratings that were less than 3 star - guess it goes to show we all have different tastes. The reviewer who stessed going back to the old classics made me remember dry, horrible, rambling selections that to this day I do not value.Water for Elephants goes beyond boy meets girl, falls in love with girl, walks into the sunset hand in hand. The interjection of the character in his later years keeps the book flowing and gives the reader a chance to develop empathy for the main character.The end is upbeat - seems a bit unbelievable - but then again it keeps the ""spark"" of the book burning bright.Looking forward to more reading from Sara Gruen."

I've loved most of his work (things started going seriously south with Rainbow Six), in particular Without Remorse. A few weeks ago, I decided that I wanted to revisit this favorite, so I purchased the Kindle edition.This novel focuses on the events leading to John Kelly's transformation into Mr. Clark, a central figure in several of the Jack Ryan-centric novels. Largely absent from Without Remorse is Clancy's typical wide-angle view of events with periodic zooms into the events in one setting or another, though it's clear that the historical context shapes the story. The story is well-paced and Clancy does a solid job of making us care about the central characters.The Kindle edition of Without Remorse, however, reads like someone tore the pages out of the novel and scanned them into the computer using a version of OCR software dating back to the mid-90s. There are quite a lot of mangled words, spacing is often weird, and punctuation frequently doesn't make sense. If you can overlook this sort of thing, the Kindle edition will work just fine for you. If you find that such problems interrupt the flow of the story, as I do, you're better off passing on the Kindle version and tracking down a hard copy from your local library or used book store."

""Red Mars"" takes readers on a journey with good character development, politics, believable conflicts, and real science (as opposed to the science in most Science Fiction, which has little basis in reality).This is a hard Science Fiction novel. For those of you who thank that Sci-Fi is cheesy monsters, blaster guns, aliens in flying saucers, and techno-babble understood only by 45 year old virgin geeks who go to conventions dressed up like Captain Kirk, well, time to read some hard Sci-Fi, and a good place to start would be with ""Red Mars"". Admittedly, there are some science concepts that may be above the head of a reader with NO concept of basic scientific terminology, however, this novel doesn't go on at length about Quantum Theory, so most people who have been through middle school science class should have no problem following along.More importantly than understanding science, is understanding the varying political theories of the Martian colonists. When it is all boiled down, this novel is more about politics than about science, or a high tech future. Unlike most Sci-Fi which tends to be played out in a far distant future wherein all society's problems have been solved, and people live in a practically utopian existence, the world of ""Red Mars"" is the world of the not to distant future, in which differing philosophies create tension, and move people to defend their dogma at any cost. Just like the real world.The brilliant part of ""Red Mars"" is that each chapter is written from a different point of view. Therein the story doesn't fall apart into the dichotomy of ""the good guys"", and ""the bad guys"", that most stories tend to fall into. Instead the reader is left to ponder what would be the best system for this world, without being given the answer directly by the author.The only real negative in ""Red Mars"" is the plethora of characters that exist in the world. It is a daunting task to remember who is who at times, and the whole time the cast of characters continuously grows as more colonists arrive on Mars. If one isn't paying attention well it is easy to forget who is who. Additionally, sometimes the story moves too fast. While terraforming a planet, building colonies, and establishing a society takes immense amounts of time, and must be moved through quickly (unless the desire is to bore the reader to death), this at times goes too fast, and things seem to appear without warning. Cities, colonists, roads, and even forests seem to appear out of nowhere. Again, the reader must be on their toes in order to not be left in the Martian dust.Overall, however, this is a strong story, with compelling characters and believable conflicts. This is how I imagine the colonization of Mars will occur in 20 or so years when we actually do begin."

It remains today, some 60 years later, one of the most watched movies.For many, their first exposure to truly fine literature may well have been a Hemingway novel. Whenever our introduction to this author took place is probably etched in our memories. His stories are related with such impact that they remain with us.And now, with this audio version there is another unforgettable experience available as actor Campbell Scott's narration takes us back to 1937 and the Spanish Civil War. Raised in Boston, Scott still has a touch of that city in his voice, which only adds to its richness. He reads with a steadfastness that pleases the ear and an intimacy that holds listeners.We hear, ""He lay flat on the brown, pine-needled floor of the forest, his chin on his folded arms, and high overhead the wind blew in the tops of the pine trees. The mountainside sloped gently where he lay; but below it was steep and he could see the dark of the oiled road winding through the pass. There was a stream alongside the road and far down the pass he saw a mill beside the stream and the falling water of the dam, white in the summer sunlight.""For many those are familiar words yet they continue to command attention as the story of Robert Jordan, a demolitions expert who has come to blow up a bridge, begins. He hopes to enlist the aid of Pablo in his mission. However, Pablo is more than reluctant, having seen enough of war he just wants to be left alone. Further he wonders what right a foreigner has to tell him what to do.Of course, there is the beautiful Maria with whom Jordan falls in love, and Pablo's wife, Pilar who is still willing to fight for the cause.Many consider this to be one of the greatest books to be found in American literature.

Wouk strikes me as a talented writer, who employs all the technical tools of his trade-such as using letters, excerpts from a military analysis (fictional) to help lend depth to his characters and a framework for the events of the novel.Winds of War, in particular, grabbed me and by the end I was frantic to get to the sequel to find out what happens to the Henry clan. I agree with another reviewer who writes about the steady developement and changes to Byron and how believeable it is. A great read (both of them) I would also recommend for similar novels (albeit different periods) &quot;A Soldier of the Great War&quot; and &quot;Killer Angels&quot;One final note, you may want to pause b/w reading the two novels as I found towards the latter third of War and Remembrance that I was getting tired of the book, but I read the two back to back over the course of three weeks."

5,3.14,0.99594,2011,02-16,7902800,Bloomingfoods,Bloomington,,Richmond,Southwest,12,"Excellent, Excellent, Excellent. One of the best war novels I've ever read. Now I know why Hemingway is known as one of the greatest writers of all time. I absolutely loved ""The Old Man and Sea"", but when ""A Farewell to Arms"" fell a little short, I had my doubts. This was the one that finally clinched it in my mind that Hemingway deserves all of the accolades he's received over the years. It's a love story that takes place up in the mountains of Spain during the Spanish Civil War which took place in the 1930's. The main character Robert Jordan, is a young American dynamiter in the International Brigade. Back in the State's Jordan used to be a college professor. Jordan's grandfather used to be a great war hero, but since his father was labeled a coward, he has set out to try to redeem the family name. It becomes his assignment to travel into the mountains of Spain, hook up with a band of guerillas, and to blow a pivotal bridge during an upcoming campaign. Not being as familiar with the Spanish Civil War as I would like have been before reading this novel it was a little hard at first to try to figure out who was fighting and what side Jordan was on. I then found out there are the Fascists vs. the Republic and Jordan is on the side of the Republic. At first I thought that members of the Republic were Communists with the ideals they were preaching and since the Russians were advising them, but then when they said some disparaging things about Communists that made me think otherwise. The guerilla band he joins up with is led by a man named Pablo who at one time used to be great leader, but recently has lost his nerve. He no longer is as interested in the cause as he once was, and now would rather tend to his horses instead. He once led this band on a successful assault on a train and everybody in the band still seems to consider this their crowning achievement. Pablo is still very smart, but nobody now knows if he can continue to be trusted to lead them. His female companion Pillar is really the one who has held the band together for the last few months of the war, but she lacks Pablo's cunning. She says she has a little bit of gypsy in her and at times she tells people's fortunes, not all of them however are good. She is very feisty and was probably something in her day when she used to date several matadors. The rest of the band is made up of an old man named Anselmo who Jordan loves very much and is one of the few people he really can rely on. Then there is a few younger men, a pair of competent brothers, plus a strong and loyal man named Agustin, as well as a gypsy who for the most part everybody considers useless. Finally there is the young girl named Maria. She was rescued from the fascists during the raid on the train. She is the daughter of a former Mayor. Her hair had all been cut off and she isn't as beautiful as she once was, but Jordan immediately falls in love with her the first time he lays eyes on her. In war a few days can sometimes seem like a life time and the pair make the most of what time they have together. Pillar had taken Maria under her wing and had been teaching her how to one day be a good wife. She approves of Jordan and Maria's union and after the fighting is over she wants him to take Maria away from this place. As the battle nears there are several scrimmages and some great fights. El Sordo's last stand is very memorable. Hemingway's descriptions are magnificent. At times Hemingway switches back and forth between Spanish and English but it never seems to be a distraction as he always provides a translation. There are things wrong with the Republic that eventually will lead to their downfall, but at this point in the war Hemingway shows them as just little inconsistencies. For instance, the Republic doesn't seem to believe in religion, so it is ironic that all of the band still say their little prayers every time they are in the middle of a battle. The people also want to rule themselves rather than be ruled by the government, but they have no trust in one another. If you are not from the same town as these people you will always be considered an outsider and an enemy. There are too many fractions in the Republic. They have some good ideals, but they are unable to really bring any of them to life. Jordan figures even if they win they would probably need to get rid of most of the leaders since the majority of the ones remaining are all incompetent or murderers. Both the Fascist and the Republic come off as being very brutal at times. I wonder what Hemingway's political views really were. I believe he probably had some of the same ideals that Jordan displays. This book will make my list of the top 100 books of all time."

5,3.34,0.9998,1992,10-07,3735500,Rosetta's Kitchen,Asheville,$$,Tulane,Southeast,10,"I would have given this a 5 star rating, but one downside to the author's early Aubrey / Maturin books, is the seemingly dire need to tell the reader about every inch of every ship, every nuance of all minutae of all things maritime, and rather than add it detracts - but this does not happen with the later books. But - overcoming all that is the fantastic ability to tell a story of life at sea and on land for Jack and Stephen; the author also handles supporting characters and sub-plots with aplomb. You will notice with this, that things are a little less maritime-detail heavy, and allows the tale to roar along. All in all, be patient, accept the author's obsessions and foibles (without them, I don't think we would have got anything, being honest) and you will enjoy this saga from the series in which Mauritius and certain strategic points have to be re-taken for the British, while at the same time Jack has to be wary of officer-rivalries, maybe even deal with a 'shy' officer, IF suspicions are confirmed, as well as co-command a Sharpe / Hornblower style combined service operation. So, a 4 starrer, chomping at the bit to be a 5 star it is, and, all things considered, very well deserved."

The first couple books were great, but in a ""Feast for Crows"" nothing happened, and worst, nothing happened to characters I didn't like. Now we're back to finding out about Bran; some more stuff about Arya (yay!); and best of all lots about Daenarys, Tyrion, and Jon. Thankfully there was nothing about Sansa nor Brienne (both of whom are nice, but both of whom are honestly kind of boring); and thankfully little about Cersei!!! Cersei is interestingly warped, but I can't read 300+ pages about her, and by the end of the previous book I wanted to scream. Jaime isn't even interestingly warped (his back-story is complicated, but in practice he's just some dude who f***ed his sister), and I really wasn't interested in reading 300+ pages of HIM.The book is pretty slow, but that's fine. Some of it I skimmed, especially when there were 20 odd page chunks of digressions about the family life, philosophy and genealogy of some character I'd never heard of and was unlikely to hear of again. Let's be honest, about 25% of the the series is the plain and simple wankery of some guy geeking out on building the arcane details of some imaginary world that any sane editor would red-pen. But the rest of it is great, and enjoyable. This was a welcome addition to the series. Finally."

I wound up finishing it while on my trip.Gruen is a wonderful story teller, you can tell she researched extensively for this novel. While it's not a book really about a circus, that is the main setting for most of the book. I really thought it would be a book all about Carnie Folk. How far from the truth was I?!The story is told from the view of an ageing circus vet, which is different to begin with.

Perhaps the plans have been influenced by this triology: sending ahead robotic-landers with equipment, housing and stores. The author is very detailed in his descriptions of equipment and the geography of Mars, probably to give veracity to the story but often I found this tedious and colorless. On occasions I thought the author was attempting only to display his own scientific knowledge (or that of his consultant). As usual in SciFi the author is hopelessly optimistic about the rate of advance of engineering (self manufacturing robotic machinery, robotic mining, smelting and forming of materials, etc) but without that the colony would have made little progress. The story gets more interesting once it gets down to the political whatifs of colonising Mars and the consequences of a deteriorating political/environmental situation on Earth. The big baddies are the multinational conglomerates who have no interest in anything but power and profit, which makes this book yet another with this theme. However none of these criticisms are shared by my husband, so you must make of that what you will!"

And, it was exactly what I assumed it was after reading several non-Amazon reviews.This book is interesting for this time period because of its subject matter,a love story set in a circus in 1930's USA. This subject is unusual for this time because circuses are rarely written about anymore. I enjoyed the author's inclusion of some research she'd done on the history of circuses. However, I didn't feel that any of the characters was developed enough to catch and hold the reader's interest such as is found in the ""I couldn't put it down"" genre of books. Also, I felt that the story being told by a 93 yr. old man, in the first person, was distracting in its flipping back and forth in two time periods. I couldn't understand what the need was for the old man in the story unless it was for the bitter-sweet, totally unrealistic end.This book should be advertised by Amazon as a book for young adults. It just does not have the depth and dedication to story as those of more experienced, and more interesting, writers."

Sadly, I think he was a little off of his game on this one. Maybe part of the problem was waiting so very long for this book. I may have gotten too much anxiety and expectation built up over the years as I waited for this book to come. Maybe another problem was that it seems this book was a transitional or ""calm-before-the-storm"" type of book. The first three books in this series while having multiple characters and multiple storylines, usually always had at least one important story that came to at least some sort of conclusion at the end of the book. This book was absent of any great climax. I THOUGHT there was one coming that events seemed to be leading up to for most of the book, but that storyline abruptly dies and left me feeling cheated.Don't get me wrong, the book was great! The characters are superb. I've grown to love many of them over the last few books. As always, Martin does a wonderful job of telling a story through the eyes of various characters each in a unique way. Rather than a 3rd person story that gives the readers facts and some insights into a broad range of characters, we see the events unfold via a personal viewpoint of different people. I think it does a better job of drawing the reader in as you experience events through each person's eyes, and feel their emotions as the drama unfolds. Sometimes we get to experience a common event through two different characters' eyes which is quite interesting. One complaint though is that the story is almost getting too big. The author keeps adding more characters, and I'm starting to reach my maximum amount of people that I care to keep track of. Also, some of the names in parts of the story such as Hizdahr Zo Loraq, Skahaz Mo Kandaq, and Reznak Mo Reznak start to run together after awhile.As usual with a Martin book, the world he creates is full of depth and detail. Every kingdom, city, family, etc. has a unique feel. It's so easy to become immersed in the story as if each place were a city that you visit all the time and every character is an old friend you've known all your life.It's surely a sign of good writing if my biggest problem is that I have grown to love the good guys so much and hate the bad guys so much that I'm getting a little impatient waiting for justice to finally come. I find myself continually hoping with each event that THIS is where the tide finally starts to turn, only to have my hopes crushed. If I look at the book as this setting in motion a string of events that will come to climax in the next book, I can be much more forgiving. However, if the storylines continue to veer off in ever-increasing paths with no end in sight, my patience is going to begin to wear thin. I have danced with the dragons long enough. It's time for this song to end and let the final battle begin!"

Also the passages in which Jacob is 90 or 93 years old were beautifully written and very believable.The not-so-good: The author often devoted long passages to the mundane and then just jumped over the parts of the story that a reader wants to spend time on (such as key dialogue between the main characters which would provide the reader with their back stories and develop a genuine love story)...which brings me to:The bad: the characters are, for the most part, one-dimensional and the character dynamics and relationships are unrealized and unbelievable. At its core, this is a romance and yet I never understood how and why the two characters fell in love. They meet and next thing I know, they are in love."

R. Martin's epic series. I'm really excited to have time to read other things and do other things, but I'm also going to miss reading about these characters daily so much! I've also made so many new blogging friends through this series because clearly it has affected a LOT of people (readers and television watchers alike!).Fortunately at least two more books have still yet to be published in this series, because unfortunately I didn't feel like this book ended the month with a bang as I was hoping it would. Don't get me wrong, I loved it, and I know that this book was a favorite for many of you; however, it fell a little flat for me, similarly to A Feast for Crows (aka AFFC). While I feel like the details are what make this series so incredible in many ways, there may have been too much detail in AFFC and A Dance with Dragons, to the point where the story didn't move forward as quickly as I expected (and needed!). I wish Martin would have compacted both of these books and made them work as one unit as originally intended. I have absolutely no idea how he would have done this (*cough*cut out the Greyjoys*cough* lol), but many of the newer characters still did not resonate with me as a reader.Now, don't get too angry with me, but I was especially disappointed with Dany's storyline; I felt like she did nothing but spin her wheels in this book!! I'm sure if I look deeper there's some great, powerful explication on her need for stability, to stop moving, her fears and doubts. But as a reader, I wanted action! I wanted Dany to keep moving forward and keep stringing bells in her hair! I need to keep reminding myself how young she is and how vulnerable she is, but I also have confidence in her as a reader and want to cheer her on. I really wish I could go into better depth on Dany, but I don't want to spoil anything at all for those of you who haven't yet read this book.As I mentioned in my review for AFFC, even the worst George R. R. Martin book is still probably the best of 100 books chosen at random. While I didn't connect with this story as deep as books 1-3 in the series, I still enjoyed the experience of reading tremendously and loved the characters. It was exciting to follow Tyrion's story and some of the new characters were especially promising to meet (like, REALLY exciting to meet. I can't stress that but I can't say more). After reading this book, I am also excited to read theories about the future of the series without being spoiled. The beauty of Martin's writing is that you can never anticipate what is going to happen next. This epic tale is truly an adventure to read and discover, and I hope that I won't have to wait long for the sixth installment, The Winds of Winter! I really don't know how fans who started reading this series in 1996 have survived all of the time between publications!Bottom Line: Not as great as books 1 through 3, but I enjoyed this one a little bit more than A Feast for Crows. A must read for anyone who has already started the series! 4/5 stars"

I could see and even smell everything, and the book movingly conveyed how desperate times led to desperate people clinging to even the most degrading employment with a third rate circus. However, the characters seemed to be straight out of a romance novel, with the exception of old(even he's not sure how old he is)Jacob, who was funny, disarming, feisty and touching -- whereas the young Jacob was pretty vanilla, too obviously a ""nice guy"" with little personality. In contrast, Old Jacob's voice was so clear and true and I really cared about him;he was funny and sad, his memories bittersweet, his longings compelling. I also liked (but who didn't?)Rosie the elephant, who had twice the personality of anyone else in the fleabag circus, with the exception perhaps of Walter, the dwarf. The plot depended on coincidences that I had problems believing, and I found myself caring more about the animals (which I admit isn't unusual for me!) than I did about any of the people. However, I'd heartily recommend this book to anyone who enjoys sentimental stories, who loves happy, pat endings, who doesn't necessarily want a book to convey great ideas, but who is touched more by the romance rather than the writing. Those of you will, as have many others, it appears, love this book. There is certainly nothing wrong with that, it's just that those kinds of books are simply not what I prefer to read. This book might actually make a good movie, and I'd be surprised if Hollywood hasn't snatched it up already."

However, the pace is not just slow, it barely moves at all, and the plot gets lost along the way. This is the third time I have tried to read it, and I still couldn't finish -- too boring. There are long, long monologs on the science, and tensions in relationships that keep you hoping for some fireworks that in many cases never materialize.These are the most boring personalities that I have seen in fiction in a long time. The story never really engages you. Spend your time reading something else."

Speaking of those two books, you definitely need to get them as this book isn't able to stand on it's own without the follow ups. I would like to say that there were quite alot of good ideas in this book. The whole terraforming of Mars is the focal point, but also the ideas of revolution aren't far fetched. After all, the same thing happened with colonies over here due to differing ideologies and the length of time it took to cross the Atlantic.There are two main drawbacks to this book that are pretty big. First off is the pace. It can be agonizingly slow almost throughout the entire book. There was only one or two parts (the book isn't divided in to chapters per se) were I wasn't struggling to stay awake. If you need something to help you get to sleep at night, read a section or two of this book. It'll do the trick. As some other reviewers have noted, a good 100 to 200 pages could have been edited out of this book and that would have helped immensely. Robinson will describe a scene in 50 pages that could easily be half that or less.My other qualm with this novel is Robinson's grasp on medical ideas. I fully believe that human life spans will continue to lengthen, even in my own lifetime. However, I don't think a miracle cure to automatically fix all of your body's problems will ever exist. That's just too far fetched for me. Furthermore, do you honestly think some scientist out on Mars with limited resources would design said drug? I wanted this book to be good, I really did. I'd have to say it's worth a read once, but it's not a page turner by any stretch of the imagination. Most people probably won't have the patience to persevere through it, honestly."

His body betrayed him years ago and Jacob now fears that his mind isn't far behind. Shuffling along miserably behind his walker, he's living out his final days in the nursing home and hating every minute of it. Just another invisible senior citizen who's family and the world as a whole has forgotten about.When the circus comes to town and sets up its Big Top tents across the street Jacob comes alive and through a series of flashbacks begins to tell us his life's story. Taking us back to when he joined the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show On Earth, a traveling circus he toured with during the great depression.At the age of 23 Jacob had a predictable future set out ahead of him, one that certainly didn't involve joining the circus. However with his parents untimely death and the bank foreclosing on his family home Jacob soon finds himself homeless, heartbroken and mentally quite unable to sit his final veterinary exams. When an exotic, animal filled train steams toward him Jacob doesn't even think. Flinging himself aboard the boxcar and inadvertently changing his destiny forever.I absolutely adored this book, alternately falling in love with both Jacob, the crotchety old man and Jacob, the young, moral and penniless circus veterinarian. Water For Elephants transported me to another time and quickly became one of those books I never wanted to end.Author Sara Gruen has researched the depression era circus life down to the smallest of details and I feel that this captivating and vivid story will appeal to almost anyone.Filled with action, adventure and a sweet forbidden romance there is also a fascinating sideshow of secondary characters including a clever Polish Elephant, a grouchy little person as Jacob's roommate and a cruel and schizophrenic animal trainer whose wife Jacob just happens to fall in love with. All of this has been wrapped together with a compelling and innovative behind the scenes look aboard a travelling circus train. Showing us more often then not the darker side of circus life after the big top closes down. This is a love story, a life story, an animal lover's story but above all it's a circus story and who of us hasn't dreamed about running away and joining the circus at some point in our lives? And the ending... *sigh*I can't say enough good about this book, its easily one of my favourite reads this year and with Robert Pattison now taking on the upcoming movie role version of Jacob, I was able to picture him while reading, making it all the more sweeter."
6,3.25,0.99392,1990,03-05,4771000,Sawatdee,Minneapolis,USD 15 - USD 35,Georgia Tech,Southeast,4,"Gruen paints a portrait of the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth, a Depression-era train circus, operated by Alan J. Bunkel, known as Uncle Al, who is described as ""a buzzard, a vulture, an eater of carrion,"" who grew fat off the carcasses of circusses that collapsed after the Crash. Their losses were his gains. The Prologue introduces the narrative which begins with a stampede of circus animals, and we are introduced to a secret which is kept by the narrator for 70 years. The reader is immediately pulled into the narrative.The narrative is juxtaposed between Jacob Jankowski's life during the seven years he spent in the circus and his present life as an irascible 90 or 93 (he can't remember which) year old man in an assisted living facility. As a young veterinary student about to graduate from Cornell, Jacob finds himself homeless and parentless and is unable to take his final exams. He finds himself jumping on a train which turns out to be Benzini's Circus train. The reader is introduced to circus lingo - rubes are the circus-goers, kinkers are the performers and Patches are the men assigned to smooth the ruffled feathers of disgruntled spectators who might be angry they didn't get their money's worth at the Freak Show or those of a homeowner whose garden has been destroyed by a wandering elephant. One is given a glimpse into the highly stratified, almost caste-like social world of the circus in which performers never rubbed elbows with the likes of the lowly workers, particulary the black workers of the Flying Squadron, who were instructed to run into their tents and remain invisible as soon as the rubes started to make their appearance.The novel is plot-driven, and although there are many stereotypical elements - there are the requisite evil villains - Uncle Al and his sidekick August Rosenbluth, the equestrian director and superintendent of animals who is hated and feared for his violent tendencies and his legendary cruelty to humans and circus animals. There is also the requisite central love story between two gentle souls sho have been dealt life's difficult blows, but whose goodness and pure intentions help them to weather the storm. There is Bobo the orangutuan and particularly Rosie the elephant, who steal our hearts, and we root for them as much as we root for Jacob and Marlena. If you are looking for a novel embedded with deep hidden meanings and rich with literary technique and complex characterization, then this is definitely not the book for you. If you are looking for a plot-driven novel whose events proceed rapidly and which transports the reader to another world, then I highly recommend this delightfully readable novel.In spite of the stereotypical elements, I thoroughly enjoyed this novel. I found myself getting up extra early and staying up extra late to get to the last page, and when I did, I was sorry the journey was over. I wasn't quite ready to say goodbye to Jacob, Marlena, Kinko, Camel, Rosie or Bobo. Perhaps I will just read it again."

Without Remorse definitly held up.The things I disliked about the book were things that would make it not a good book. I generally dislike the language a lot of the characters used, especially those in the drug rings. But I realize that is probably true to life and must tolerate it in that snese. It does serve the purpose of making me dislike the drug cartels even more than I already did, if that's possible.I felt fear and apprehension while Kelly/Clark returns to VietNam. I understood why he did the things he felt he had to do, though terribly wrong in principle. I liked most that Kelly/Clark realized he could not change the world, only contribute in some small sense. If he believed he could right all the wrongs in the world, it wouldn't be as compelling to read. But he wants to typify the idea that good people cannot stand aside and let evil occur, else they are supporting that evil. But he does it with a vigilante type justice that should only be taken up in novels.I relly liked how the Ryan family became involved in the story. If foreshadowed and made me think what would Emmett think knowing his son will soon be under the protection of that 'Invisible Man'?Without Remorse is a definite must to those who are Clancy fans.

I won't even bother to read the 5-star reviews because I'll probably agree with all the specifics about what a good book this is. It has colorful, well-fleshed out characters with only a few cardboard stereotypes, great sense of historical and circus detail, and a neat surprise ending.The trouble is, this does not belong up there with some great recent, innovative works, the true 5-stars, like Memoirs of a Geisha or The Kite Runner. One thing they all have in common is introducing us to a foreign or unfamiliar world, in this case the depression-era circus. But those other two books have a depth of soul, and a more comprehensive world-view, than Water for Elephants.I was also disappointed with a big, loose thread in the plot, where Camel was to be reunited with his son and the reader was set for that pivotal event, only to be let down and short-circuited by the surprise ending.You will definitely enjoy this book, and be enlightened to learn more about life during the Depression, but keep it in perspective, let's not give standing ovations for every good show."

The circus in the Great Depression era is a great setting for the underlying love story. The internal struggles the main characters go through are timeless, and highly resonate with our modern times, perhaps in part because both eras had economic hardship. The book is narrated by a 93 (or 96, as he can't remember his real age) man. His character is very well put together, very real. The book has an optimistic message of triumph over adversity and the value of friendship and true love."

The quality of GRRM's writing was as good in books 4 & 5 as it was in 1-3; the only difference was that a lot of the scenes seemed to create more questions than answers. A Dance with Dragons was filled with character development, and assuming GRRM is going to tie up all loose ends in books 6 & 7, this is a 5-star book."

I read this recently, since it has a reputation as one of the great Amerian novels, and my particular HS required no Hemingway. I figured the time had come.So now, having read it, I think For Whom the Bell Tolls was an important milestone, something of a product of its times. There was not yet such a body of anti-war or humanist literature as there is now...perhaps Hemingway played a role in creating that. Still, it is not just an anti-war book; intelligent people have known a long time, as Sherman put it, that war is simply ""brutality"" that cannot be made pretty. So this is not Hemingway's main point. If anything, he even sounds pro-war in the brief sections that justify the Spanish Civil War and the fight against the Fascists. (He seems a little blind to the pact the Spanish Republicans made with the devil, i.e. the Russian communists, but history had not yet proven the bloodthirstiness and corruption of the Soviet Union.)Hemingway's main theme in this book is personal honor, and how personal concerns affect one's perceptions and may override original, idealistic motives. The hero, American dynamiter Robert Jordan, has snuck behind Fascist lines to help destroy a bridge and aid a planned Republican frontal attack. But three things happen - his guerilla teammates are led by a very disillusioned old veteran, who argues bitterly with his tough old wife; and Robert falls in love Maria, with a refugee they are sheltering, raped and nearly killed by the Fascists. Finally, his spying reveals the front is losing the element of surprise. In this dangerous situation, he wants to call it all off, and retreat to a life of happiness with Maria. Sorry, no further plot will be revealed here....This way we get to study two different couples. We learn that Pablo and Pilar, the guerillas, have killed many people, up-close and personal. Pablo seems to have enjoyed it. Pilar did less hands-on killing but she and the others are still dedicated to the cause. Now here comes an outsider, a handsome young American with no real dog in this fight, bringing the front closer just when Pablo has had enough. Even worse, he falls for Maria, and sleeps with her in his own bag, outside the cave. (The love scenes, though not very graphic, are pretty juicy for their time.) Pilar tries to bolster Robert's resolve, even plotting against her husband. Maria is lost without Robert, and will follow him anywhere. But where will Robert end up going? He has committed himself, and he wants to fulfill his duty as a matter of honor. What destiny will bring the best honor for both himself and Maria? Having sacrificed so much so far, what further sacrifice do any of these people need to maintain their honor?Unlike many contemporary books, FWTBT does not have a big, overwhelming climax. Instead, the ending unfolds in a way that you might have expected, as you read it. This unfortunately left me a little cold, unable to decide whether I Love the Book, the way I do some others. But it is an indispensable milestone. Perhaps better read if you are not already so jaded or anti-war that you can't conceive of a cause worth fighting for."

The characters were believable - Jake as the 91 (or 93) year old and his remembering of his life as a 23 year old. Anyone who has been to the yesteryear circus will recognize the descriptions of the circus coming to town and the excitement of the residents. There are funny incidents and sad ones that make up this book and the usual good and bad characters we all encounter. I admired the 91 year old Jake for his spunk when he took charge of his life as I admired the 23 year old Jake when he did the right thing for the animals of the circus. A great story that is heartwarming too.

It has always amazed me how elephants put up with us ignorant humans and our slow mentality in catching on as to how to treat them according to their abilities. The fact that elephants haven't done away with all evil handlers is a testament to the amazing personality, patience and attitude of their creation. The circus realm has a lot of shame, guilt and blame placed at its feet. Even though this is a fictional story, the real stories of circus elephants is much worse and a hard read. I'm looking forward to another place in time where all will live in peace with all living things as this great earth was intended."

If you have just finished reading The Great Gatsby and are interested in the jaded, bored-with-life, spoiled and rich who drink and drink, read The Sun Also Rises. If you've just finished Dr. Blade #57, you like senseless action, and just want to say you've read Hemingway, try To Have and Have Not.

It mirrored the reality of my military experience.

He was an adventurer, a family man, a man who held interesting views on just about every subject under the sun, and finally, in his later years, a martyr to life. Although this book was written by Renoir's middle son, Jean, it is as vibrant and alive as if Renoir, himself, had just written the words in his own hand. Through this book we learn how the Renoir family left its roots in Limoges and moved to Paris. We read of Renoir's early years as a painter of porcelain and how and why he became an artist, more specifically, an Impressionist. We learn of Renoir's marriage to Aline Charigot of Essoyes, the birth of his three sons and his move to the south of France. Some of the most interesting sections of the book deal with Renoir's feelings about the effect of light on a painting and why he needed to paint in a &quot;natural&quot; setting. Also, most interesting are the chapters on the birth of Impressionism and Renoir's relationships with the other artists of the time, such as Monet, Manet, Sisley and Cezanne, just to name a few. Lovingly and charmingly written, this book truly brings Renoir to life and makes him accessible to all. Absolutely a must for anyone with even a passing interest in art or artists!"
5,3.2,0.99491,1993,01-06,5107500,Boston's Gourmet Pizza,Veradale,,LSU,Midwest,11,"In this sensitive portrayal of love and war, author Itani reveals the life of Grania O'Neill from her earliest days in Deseronto, Canada, through her marriage to Jim Lloyd, who serves in the Ambulance Corps during World War I. Grania has been deaf since the age of five, and Itani opens her inner world to the reader, using Grania's voice to tell the story and gracefully conveying her deafness as part of her selfhood, not as a handicap. Using short sentences of twelve to fifteen words when Grania is a young child trying to figure out her world, Itani begins the story in a simple subject-verb-object pattern, using no complicated clauses or involved syntax, which Grania herself would be incapable of using. When Grania becomes fluent in sign language and lip-reading, the sentence structure becomes more complex. By the time she marries Jim, a hearing man, sentences and syntax are fully developed, and Grania's ability to recognize ambiguity, to see relationships between events, and to respond fully to a hearing world are obvious in her &quot;voice.&quot;The point of view alternates between Grania and Jim, once Jim goes off to war, and important themes--war and peace, life and death, love and friendship, and strength and dependence--weave and develop throughout their contrasting worlds, Grania at home and Jim at the front in Belgium. Itani develops these age-old themes in new ways, sensitively incorporating them with the imagery of sounds and silence, sight and shadows, action and inaction, images we have come to associate with the life Grania and Jim share. In Jim's traumatic world, sound becomes overwhelming: pounding guns, explosions, screams of agony from wounded soldiers. As a result of his life with Grania, however, he is also acutely sensitive to what he sees, discovering, ironically, that it is the hands of the dead and dying that communicate most vividly because they &quot;revealed the final argument: clenched in anger, relaxed in acquiescence, seized in a posture of surprise or forgiveness.&quot;The subordinate characters further flesh out the themes. The friendship and interdependence of Jim and Irish, his best friend parallel the love and support Grania has received from her sister, her remarkable grandmother, and her deaf friends. Grania gains strength through them and is able to give support and strength to others when they need her, just as Jim gains strength from his relationship with Irish and continues to rescue the wounded and dying. As the reader comes to know Grania and Jim and the love they feel for each other, Grania's silent but active world becomes more and more understandable to the reader. Ultimately, the reader has to agree with Grania when she declares, ironically, &quot;Sound is always more important to the hearing.&quot; Mary Whipple"

The story is told in alternating time periods, Jacob recounting his youth from the confines of an assisted living facility. After the horrific death of his parents during the Great Depression, Jacob drops out of school and begins working with the Benzini Brothers circus. He quickly discovers the dark secrets so well-hidden behind the cheerful, humorous faade of circus shows. While on the road Jacob grows up and learns a great deal about life ""out in the real world"" while traveling with the circus, including lessons on friendship, trust, love and self-reliance.This novel is extremely plot driven and is not a literary challenge by any means. I appreciate the take on circus life; this isn't something that is commonly written about. It was still very enjoyable and interesting, and I would recommend it for all readers."

Water for Elephants reads like a children's novel, save for excessive and serious profanity, graphic and frequent sex scenes, and violence so vivid I was moved to nausea. If you are able to ignore those sorts of things, you will not find yourself feeling any kind of sympathy for the one-dimensional characters. The characters do not develop over the course of the story, and seem only concerned with dabbling in vice. As a result, I was unable to identify with them.A portion of the story is written from the point of view of the main character in his old age. This writing is exceptional, and managed to keep me interested during the course of the book. Still, these marvelous little glimpses of author Sara Gruen's potential do not permit me to recommend this book to anybody. Avoid it."

Sara Gruen literally places you in the middle of a 1920's traveling circus and dosen't drop you off until the very last page. I felt like I was right along side Jacob and Marlena and the rest of the Characters in the novel.The story was breath-taking, and captivating, and the characters and even the animals were so easy to like and so different in their roles and I loved it. This is one of the first historical fiction novels i've read in a long time, at least that come to mind, and although I was apprehensive to start this, i'm so happy I picked it up when I did. I'm really looking forward to seeing the movie adaptation of this as it is currently in theaters now, and as a true book-lover must read the novel before I go see the movie adaptation of it!! I have high expectations for this film so we will see what I think, but so far i've heard good things.Water for Elephants is an absolutly delightful story, it covers everything a truly remarkable novel should have; love, crime, secrets, drama, etc. this book has it all!flag"

And all in 400 pages.This is ""resting""?Martin is not the ""American Tolkien"" nor any other kind of Tolkien. He is, if anything, the prose equivalent of Yanni, perpetual middle and no end. Those who love this kind of work -- stylistically similar to The Osbournes, The Kardashians, New Jersey Housewives, even The Sopranos (particularly if Tony had been killed during the first season) -- will likely love this, and will continue to do so as the characters, plots, venues and volumes multiply.Martin had a promising first act, but the literary world is replete with promises that quickly fizzle.

Since obviously I couldn't discuss much with him, but he still wanted to know, as everyone else has been wanting to know:""Is it good?""Yes it's good. It's better than a Feast for Crows by virtue of it's characters alone. But wow, it's also incredibly frustrating. Sorry for the quick change of mood there, but that's exactly what it's like to read this book. Moments will make you snap to attention and instantly remember why you've waited so long for the series, and how you loved it in the first place. This book has the power to draw you away from your world and into its. But these are but brief illuminations in a dark and often blindly led journey.Dance's biggest problem is it's pacing, which is to say stop and go. Whenever you think something major is about to happen, the book seems intent at preventing it. And yet this is a gargantuan of a novel. What makes up the extra space in between actual happenings? Exposition and traveling. So much of what is spoken could have only been mentioned and still had the same effect. Take for instance every Victarion Greyjoy chapter. Are the iron born interesting? Yes they are and very much so. Is there any amount of information in his chapters that couldn't have been neatly condensed into one? No.This becomes a problem later on when things should be picking up but never seem to. There is hardly a character in this book that doesn't seemingly have their story end one chapter (or more) too short. And not in the ""I must know what happens next"" way, but rather in the ""I fear this may be another six year cliffhanger"" manner. Then there is the almost laughable cases of Bran and Davos. I swear to the seven that I flipped back through the book just to make sure that I didn't somehow miss more of their chapters. Let me save you the time. You didn'tThe other major problem is actually some of the characters themselves. Yes, they are much better than the ones we got in Feast for Crows, but only barely. The biggest offender is no other than Tyrion himself. His story is long, mildly eventful, sometimes utterly bizarre (in ways good and bad), but worst of all (and I can't believe I'm writing this) it's humorless. A chuckle here and there maybe, but for the most part Martin loses his way with Tyrion's dialogue. Danerys sadly fairs much the same. She (and Tyrion for that matter) has some INCREDIBLE moments in this book, but for the most part she spends her time spinning her wheels and kicking up mud all around here the whole time. Yet again, it's all in an effort to end the story in an interesting place and then take what may happen away for another day. Which leads us to Jon Snow. The strongest of the three major characters, Jon's story sees him discovering leadership as well as himself as a person. It's a good story with some great little moments, and even in its' drawn out passages it still seems the most driven. Yet it ends with not only a cliffhanger for his own situation, but the ones of others as well who don't get their own final chapters.There's also a problem with new additions. I'll be brief. Tyrion meets an uninteresting dwarf woman who gets much dialogue and time, Danerys is practically surrounded by a cast of ""who?""s that you get to know and become ""who cares""?, many sell sword companies are introduced out of the blue and now have quite a bit of sway. None of those compare to the holy mother of ""huh?"" characters however. For the sake of extreme spoilers I will not mention the name, but the character comes right out of the blue and can completely change everything that has been done so far. I hope there is a satisfying reasoning to this...surprise and it wasn't just done to give us a mini-me version of a well dead character we could never have, but I fear the later.Yet I give this book 3 stars, and I say it is good. That's because it is. For instance take the surprising quality of the Reek chapters. By now, I'm going to assume it's no major spoiler to say that Reek is Theon Greyjoy. It might be a spoiler however to let you know that his chapters might be the best in the book. They are purposeful, deliberate, and constantly interesting. They also introduce us to some fantastic new villains in the Boltons, and just for hell he becomes a rallying point of sorts for other major characters. In Theon's story you will find that old magic once again that the first three books had in spades.He's not the only one. Davos and Bran may be cut short, but what's there is great. The activities of King Stannis and those around him are always interesting and make for some of the best intrigue in the book. Asha Greyjoy has a short but sweet story that puts her in an active position within the overall story. Ser Barristan Selmy has a few very, very good chapters. And while I still find Tyrion's chapters to be boring, Jon and Danerys overall provide the major plots of this tale, and both contribute enough to make it worth while. The best characters though? The precious few chapters we get from the Feast for Crows gang. Not only do they advance the unresolved plots of Jamie, Cersei, and No One, but they are also some of the best written of the bunch further suggesting that Martin knows where he going with the plot, but that he needed these last two books to turn a real big ship around to get there.Then there are those moments. In fact I retract my earlier statement. It's not the characters that make this better than a Feast for Crows, it's those damn moments. This installment spreads them around more liberally than its' predecessor did, and is the much better for it. This book feels more alive than A Feast for Crows, even when it's just shuffling it's feet. Plus like I said, it may take a while to get there but by the end of this book the whole overall plot feels much more on track and focused. Oh and that last chapter? Gravy. Pure indulgence and a fantastic bookend to both fully hype you for book six and remind you the power Martin still wields with a pen over your very soul and even your expectations.Ultimately I may have fallen under the same curse as Martin and spoke too many words. Because you will read this book and you very much should. Ultimately some will say that the wait was too long for too much unresolved. Maybe that's true. But as a whole and judged on it's own this is a more than solid entry into the Ice and Fire series and, while not destined to become everyone's favorite, is still a hard work of fiction to out right hate.But George, can I sum up quickly what fans want for Winds of Winter?More Dragons, Less Dancing."

Did the person writing this ""blurb"" read the book? Probably not. In parts of this novel the author writes as if possessed by James Joyce, in a stream of consciousness style with long sentences. That's OK, or would be, if they added to the novel but, sorry, they don't. The author is also repetitive, repeating the same point over and over in some cases. But there is no reason in terms of the plot in writing the same point over and over in this book except to (in my opinion) stretch this novella out into almost 500 pages. The first couple and the last couple of chapters are essentially where the action is. One has to ask why this story is so revered and I think the answer is because the author was so admired. The press especially hero-worshiped Hemingway and perhaps this explains the too-much praise for this work. Still, not a bad book and when it's good, it's very good."

As far as plot, structure and style go, I don't have enough space to praise Robinson. It's an EPIC (in capital letters). Granted, he is often a bit long winded, but most of the time &quot;Red Mars&quot; is a page turner with substance. His introductory vignetts at the beginning of each section of the book, in particular, demonstrate his literary muscle. You'll be sold after the first three pages!The story is excellent, but as or more impressive is Robinson's portrait of the socio-economic/cultural conditions which develop on the planet. Coming from the rather arrogant post-modernistic attitude of &quot;we've invented everything that can be invented&quot; insofar as culture, politics, etc. is concerned, this book is a refreshing surprise. From the environmental Marsfirst movement to the Neo-marxism, the world Robinson has created is rich and interesting.His characterization is even better. Normally, I would resent the obvious plot device, longjevity (sp?), Robinson uses to allow his characters to live through Mars' entire evolution. However, his characters are so different and engaging that I was easily able to grant him that crutch.Finally, &quot;Red Mars&quot; also has convincing (at least for a lay person like myself) science. Their scientific gadgets which allow them to make Mars more Earth-like are giddily exotic while staying real enough that I wouldn't be surprised to read about them in the morning paper.Ultimately, &quot;Red Mars&quot; accels at characterization, story, style, scope and science stuff.

You can smell the disinfectant in the nursing home when Jacob is there.I guess one of the reasons I liked this book is that I've never read something on this topic.

One word of advice: Read the book BEFORE seeing the movie. While both book and film can each stand alone, reading the book first makes the movie so much more enjoyable. The story is uniquely compelling, and the author does an excellent job of describing the life and times of a Depression-era circus. I just couldn't put the bloody book down!Like the author before writing this book, I'd never been to a circus before. However, I did grow up with Depression survivor grandparents, especially my grandmother, who was infamous locally for feeding the hobos who passed through our poor little railroad town. Even when she had little to feed her three children, the transients who spotted the hobo tags on their back fence never went away empty-handed.I have been fascinated by stories of the circus since visiting the Ringling Circus Museum in Sarasota, Florida at the age of eight.

What a powerful read. This book puts you into circus life in the Depression, shakes you until you are groggy and then wakes you up to find that you can't stop thinking about the story. Ms. Gruen has obviously done her homework as she draws you into the seedy,muddy, bloody life of the circus. Very much unlike my experiences, as a child, going to see ""THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH,"" circus life is portrayed as something less than glamorous.

I am happy to say, that today, I am well acquainted with his work. The Prophet was the first book I read written by Gibran, and ever since that first reading I have immersed myself in his extraordinarily consummate skill of exquisitely crafted words. To say the Prophet or any other writings by Kahlil Gibran is simply fine literature is to say the mysterious of the soul are mediocre. I recommend that if you have not touched upon any of Kahlil Gibran's books, that you consider the Prophet as a good start. You will not be disappointed. A few other extraordinary works of art by Gibran: The Voice Of The Master; The Beloved; Sand And Foam; The Broken Wings; Between Night And Morn; The Earth Gods; and one of my personal favorites, though not so much a ""story,"" but rather a collection of personal letters to dearly beloved friends: Kahlil Gibran: A Self-Portrait."

A major focus of my interest was the Nuremberg Trials in which the surviving Nazi big wigs were brought to justice in an extensive judicial review of the high crimes of Nazi Germany. The world was focussed on the trials and an Academy Award-winning feature film was made about them as well. When I read a review of ""The Other Nurembeg: The Untold Story of the Tokyo War Crimes Trials"", it may have been the first I knew that there actually was such an inquest. I never came across it at book stores so I sought it out on Amazon.com to find out just what the trials were all about.These trials were somewhat different from their German counterpart. One difference was the control that General MacArthur held over the creation and (to a small extent) control of the trials. There were also a lot more countries represented on the Bench. Instead of the Big Four in Europe, the Americans, English and Chinese were joined by jurists from Australia, the Soviet Union, The Netherlands, The Philipines, India, and France. The chief judge was an Australian and the chief prosecutor was an American. The accused, however, were all Japanese.There were a variety of issues involved such as the Rape of Nanking, the forced labor, the surprize attack on Pearl Harbor, the killing of POW's and shooting survivors of torpedoed ships, the mass murders in China, The Philipines and elsewhere. The issue of waging an agressive war was also an issue which was worked over and defined.The genesis of the tribunal and the prosecution of the trials are spelled out well in Arnold Brackman's researched recollection as a journalist covering the trials at the time. Some topics and crimes may seem to be covered in less detail that the reader may prefer. However, Brackman's description of the tens of thousands of pages of evidence and testimony gives us an overall aprreciation of the author's ability to summerize the major points of the trials. There are a lot of incidents referred to that may have escaped the attention of many readers. The initial outbreak of the invasion in China was an event known as the Mukden Incident which was news to me. At times the vollume of brutality left the author acknowledging that there was a lot more than he (or the tribunal) had time to cover.Brackman had a good sense of the personalities and rivalries involved in the judges and lawyers working in the trials. He also was rather defensive at times regarding that variety of opinions back home about the War and its' causes. He is also willing to speak frankly about some of the merits of the defense of the accused. For example, he points out that the Japanes army had ""liberated"" a number of European colonies in Asia. However, Brackman also points out that the Japanese were more brutal to their Asian captives than they were to the European ones.At times the book seems more oriented to a legal focus rather than an historic one but this is, afterall, about a trial rather than a battle. In the end, the trial, having lasted well past what was expected, came to an end with seven executions and a number of lengthy prison sentences of which most ended with parole in the mid-1950's.The Tokyo trials were not the focus of the world like their Nuremberg counterpart. However, they were an important reminder that, even in war there are standards of decency. The evidence that we do get reminds us of the reason for the trial. ""The Other Nuremberg"", like the trials themselves, is valuable for the closure that it brings to the end of a brutally waged war of agression."

5,3.38,0.99306,2001,05-10,5180900,,Volcano,,Butler,Midwest,10,"I've been reading Tom Clancy since 1989, when my dad gave me copies of Hunt for Red October and Red Storm Rising as I left for college. I've loved most of his work (things started going seriously south with Rainbow Six), in particular Without Remorse. A few weeks ago, I decided that I wanted to revisit this favorite, so I purchased the Kindle edition.This novel focuses on the events leading to John Kelly's transformation into Mr. Clark, a central figure in several of the Jack Ryan-centric novels. Largely absent from Without Remorse is Clancy's typical wide-angle view of events with periodic zooms into the events in one setting or another, though it's clear that the historical context shapes the story. The story is well-paced and Clancy does a solid job of making us care about the central characters.The Kindle edition of Without Remorse, however, reads like someone tore the pages out of the novel and scanned them into the computer using a version of OCR software dating back to the mid-90s. There are quite a lot of mangled words, spacing is often weird, and punctuation frequently doesn't make sense. If you can overlook this sort of thing, the Kindle edition will work just fine for you. If you find that such problems interrupt the flow of the story, as I do, you're better off passing on the Kindle version and tracking down a hard copy from your local library or used book store."

The Spanish Steps will become a sea of azaleas and the various stational churches and basilicas will get themselves all decked out in finery and flowers for their special feast days (e.g. San Lorenzo in Lucina awash in roses and orchids on Friday of the 3rd week in Lent). If you are fortunate enough to be planning a trip to Roma by all means avail yourself of ""The Companion Guide to Rome"" by Georgina Masson. It's in several editions but I prefer the earlier ones without the updates by Mr. Fort. My current favorite is a 1966 edition. This book is in a class all it's own in the mass of publications about the city of Rome. It is probably not a book to drag around all day as you tramp the streets of the Eternal City but then why not (it doesn't weigh much more than a water bottle). But it is certainly a book to have in your hotel room to read about the neighborhood you are about to visit or the one you visited the day before. Ms Masson gives lots of details about museums, churches and architecture but it is as much poetic-literature as it is a guide book, she is one with her city (she lived there for many years) and wants us to feel that along with her. For me she succeeds admirably! Earlier this year when I was longing to be in Rome but couldn't be I picked up the Companion Guide then read each chapter with great care and observation as Ms Masson walked me through the tangled streets and lively piazzas, in and out of churches and museums and to favorite little escapes, unknown to most people, but waiting to be discovered guided by the adventerous, creative spirit of Georgina. Highly reccommended."

Just as something exciting happens it switches to Jacob struggling as an old man in a nursing home. There are plenty of plot twists and surprises. The book is a very detailed description of a disgusting circus in the 1930's from the illegal moonshine to straining horse trough water through a pair of clowns panty hose to make lemonade, and the red lighting (when they are thrown off of the train over a tressle) of unwanted employees. Although the main character has some difficulty, you know it will be ok in the end because he tells it as an old man in a nursing home. During his time in the circus Jacob makes some very interesting friends, like Walter the midget clown, Earl the gentle security guard ,and Uncle Al who is way more of a jerk than he seems.

I&#8217;m so glad I got to finish this in 2013 to totally finish the read along for A Song of Ice and Fire all in 2013! PHEW!!!! And now that I&#8217;m finished&#8230; Can you say series hangover?So A DANCE WITH DRAGONS. It&#8217;s a toss up between that and A STORM OF SWORDS to name a favorite of the series so far because both were pretty epic in their own rites (although for the love of Pete, these are all flipping epic) but A DANCE WITH DRAGONS felt a bit more anticipated simply because of the full-length novel set-up that was A FEAST FOR CROWS. As stated in my review for AFFC, this was more the &#8220;part two&#8221;, focusing back on the main characters that dominated the first three books and boy, was I happy to see them again!First things first: THE DRAGONS. WOOOOO!! Loved seeing their prominence in this book and consequently, how badass (yes, even more so) that Dany became because of her dedication to them. She&#8217;s also pretty badass on her own and she&#8217;s still one of my favorite characters! I loved how much the dragons affected the characters themselves as well as the overall plot of the book.One thing I notice looking back from when I first picked up A GAME OF THRONES is really how different these characters are from when the series first started. The villains have shown their softer side and they&#8217;ve suffered their own plights as well. Many people that started off the series as antagonists had me feeling quite a bit of sympathy for them! Also, of course, spending so much time with all of the characters has really instilled a place in my heart for them. We&#8217;ve been reading these massive books for ten months now and when I finished&#8230;. I honestly didn&#8217;t know what to do. Sometimes I still feel weird that I&#8217;m NOT reading them because I hadn&#8217;t taken a break for ten months!As usual, GRRM throws in a few insane twists that you did not see coming. And I love it. At times, sure, I still want to throttle him (as I&#8217;m sure most of his readers do), but I also appreciate that the heroes of these books are never fully safe. I find something realistic about that because hey, bad things happen to the good guys too.The way this plot has grown from the first book is incredible too. There are so many different layers of the story &#8212; from one character to the next and multiple characters being involved in many different big events. Even the smallest things they do can turn out to have a big effect on the entire story. It&#8217;s quite fascinating how detailed this world is and yet how well GRRM keeps it all together and constantly moving."
8,3.29,0.996,1986,08-01,5519400,Taco John's,Fremont,,Auburn,West,8,"There is a somewhat humorous analogy hidden somewhere in the sea of black letters about a constipated fat man trying to take a sh!t. That pretty much sums up this book. Actually, Martin's sea of letters is much like the Dothraki sea....it is a huge expanse of repetitive scenery in which nothing much of significance happens.As a caveat, I loved the 1st 3 books. I also love the world Martin has created and do not mind his verbosity in describing characters and settings in detail. I also do not mind the violence, sex, or fickleness of the world he has created. However, Martin's fundamental problem with AFFC and ADOD is that he does not move the plot forward. He introduces so many new characters that I have an easier time keeping track of the elves names in the Similarion. I understand he is expanding the universe and building up the ""eastern/southern"" culture. But so many of his characters are pointless. And by pointless, I mean that they are introduced only to die or disappear after having contributed nothing to the plot or storyline. Also, Martin feels the need to create an intricate backstory for every character--which would be fine if they did something important. Why do I, as a reader, need to slog through 5 pages of filler backstory for a charter who makes only minor appearances?Additionally, why oh why does he insist upon giving us a morass of characters with similar sounding unpronounceable names? There is another scene in the book where one of the characters complains that all of the names sound alike and he cannot distinguish one from the next.....that would be pretty funny except for the fact that it is the very same experience I had reading the book. Martin has an infatuation with arkks zzzts dizarss razakss that all blend together. If you are going to give a character a wierd name, at least make the character interesting. I had to constantly look up people's names because the names were so unpronounceable and characters so forgettable! And then in the middle of the arkks zzzts dizarss razakss, there is a shavepate. When i read that I said WTF is a shavepate? and again needed to turn to the internet.Another example of Martin's inability to move along the plot is the storyline of Tyrion in this book. I completely understand what Martin is doing with Tyrion's character, but he just takes so long to do it. I mean, the whole river story plot-line was utterly pointless. Martin could have just had Tyrion get kidnapped on his way to Pentos and wind up in Merreen with half the pages. Don't get me wrong, I LIKED the river storyline.....but it didn't get us anywhere. To make another LOTR comparison, it would be like following Sam and Frodo all the way to Mount Doom only to have Frodo decide that the whole ring-quest thing is rather silly, and he'd rather throw in with the elves leaving Middle-Earth.Also, Martin's knack for bringing dead characters back to life hurts the story and diminishes the world he has created. I liked the fact that no main character was safe. But if they are all going to come back to life anyways....what's the point in them dying to begin with? Then, to make matters worse, he doesn't even use the potential of these undead characters. Catlin Stark as an angry p!ssed off ghost hell-bent on killing all the Freys would have made for interesting reading. Unfortunately, there is none of that in this book. There is another character whom we presumed was dead that makes an appearance, but all he does is float down a river.Then, there is Martin's equal knack for sucking the life out of characters that we loved. Tyrion becomes little more than a drunken court jester who constantly asks where whores go. No cunning; no real witticisms; no plotting. Tyrion just does as he's told and makes an a$$ out of himself. Dany goes from a powerful intriguing character to a whinny teenager obsessed with screwing bad boys. The Dragons go from being the ultimate chess piece, to little more than pets locked in a cage...that escape. Bran turns into a tree....literally. Jon turns down the opportunity to reclaim his rightful place as a Stark and instead decides to count sausages and wildings and does everything possible to pi$$ people off around him. So much wasted potential. Barristan the Bold is now Barristan the Old. Within 2 books, Martin has managed to suck all the life out of all my favorite characters. I did enjoy the Arya story/assassin training, but it was done in such a way that it had nothing to do with the plot of the main story. Stannis does nothing but stand in snow and grit his teeth. The Red Woman stares into fires and prays a lot. Cercie gets her comeuppance, but in a fashion that is entirely bereft of poetic justice. And then SURPRISE! Someone else we thought was dead is back again! Someone gie me an Arrrrgggkra!At this point, I don't know if I even care how this thing comes out. And now, I read it that he intends to write EIGHT--not seven books to finish this story.The most frustrating part of it all is that he has done such a good job of setting up the finale, it should not take so long to get there. In order to finish this off, he needs the following to occur: 1) The Others need to attack; 2) Dany needs to invade Westeros; 3) Ayra needs to finish her assassin training and return to Westeros on a mission that tears her soul up (i.e., she needs to be sent to kill Sansa or someone she cares about); 4) Samwell needs to get back to the wall and finish his transformation from coward to unlikely hero; 5) Cercie needs to die a painful horrible death; 6) The dragons/Bran/Samwell kill all the Others; 7) Tyrion marries his dwarf girl; and 8) I don't even care who gets the iron throne at this point.Despite all this, yes, I will pony up the dough to read the next offering in this adrift series with the small hope it gets back on course."

This is odd, in a way: Claude was an old man (and in pain) when Jean got to know him, and Jean was an old man when he finally brought his recollectios together. You might expect cranky, but nothing of the sort: it's a book full of sunny afterglow. Every parent would hope to be rememnbered so well.The book might take a bit of getting used to: Jean has his own pace and his own way of telling his story. We did it in small doses and I'm not certain yet that I quite catch the rhythm. None of the rough edges have been smoothed off which, come to think of it, is just as Claude would have wanted: Jean speaks with his own voice. You have to listen well, but you know that the voice is nobody else's.I suppose it helps to know a bit about the Impressionists to enjoy it all, but I can't say I know all that much, and I didn't feel impaired. Anyway, God bless Google: more than once, when Jean talked about a painting or a subject, I key-clicked my way to an image and completed (as it were) the picture.Kudos also to NYRB (this time) for producing what it does not always produce: a finished physical specimen The paper feels like quality; the binding is sturdy, and there is a small but satisfying selection of pictures, both colored and black-and-white. There is even an index of sorts (I assume from the original translator) but it is patchy and incomplete. That last is a shortcoming, but forgivable in light of the book's other virtues. In the NYRB firmament, this is surely a star."

But I'm a ""hard sell"" for fiction, and I can see by the other reviews that many people loved it. Lucky them!On a slightly more analytic level, I'd say that what prevented me from enjoying the book was the ""voice"" of the narrator, who is supposed to be a man in his nineties remembering his youth in the circus. I'm a man approaching seventy, with some circus experiences as a teenager in Iowa and as the father of a circus acrobat in the Cirque de Soleil era. I found the ""voice"" of the narrator unconvincing, extremely unconvincing, as a male of the species and as a male American of the 1930s and 1940s. I couldn't get past that central implausibility. I found myself scoffing at the sensibilities of the pseudo-male narrator at every emotional turn of this quite melodramatic novel."

5,2.91,0.9998,2009,01-13,15502200,,Nashville,$$,Marquette,West,6,"I was enthralled by The Winds of War when it was released in the early 1970's, and enjoyed the mini-series with Robert Mitchum and Ali MacGraw in the early 1980's. A couple of years ago I found a tattered paperback in a second hand bookstore and enjoyed reading it again. About the same time cable TV screened the mini-series over a week and I was enthralled again.This book, and the sequel War and Remembrance, are Wouk's largest fictional works and give a comprehensive coverage of many of the major events before and during WWII. The Winds of War tells the story of the lead up to WWII through the eyes of Navy Commander Victor ""Pug"" Henry who is appointed Naval Attache in Berlin 6 month's before Hitler's invasion of Poland in September 1939. He travels widely throughout Europe as President Roosevelt's unofficial eyes and ears in Europe, meeting most of the key players during those tumultuous times. During this time Pug begins a platonic but very close and borderline romantic relationship with Pamela Tudsbury, daughter of a famous British radio personality.This book and War and Remembrance are classic novels about WWII. Wouk devoted ""thirteen years of extraordinary research and long, arduous composition"" to these two memorable novels.Since moving to Kindle format I am slowly gathering copies of my favourite books for my Modern Classics Kindle Library. This book certainly gets a place in that library and I am waiting for better pricing before adding War and Remembrance. Last week I added all 6 volumes of Churchill's memoirs of the war to this library when they were a Kindle Daily Deal for $1.99. The world of the Kindle really is a marvellous place.I also enjoyed Wouk's 1990's books, ""The Power"" and ""The Glory"", about the establishment of Israel and the 1967 Six Day War and the 1973 Yom Kippur War. After that I assumed that Wouk had retired but was astounded to find that, at the age of 97, he will publish a new novel in November,The Lawgiver, about the life of Moses. I pre-ordered it immediately."

7,3.11,0.99517,2017,09-06,7531000,Earth Fare,Greenville,,Princeton,West,12,"George R. R. Martin has been compared to Tolkein, primarily because he borrows heavily from Tolkein's mythology (and openly admits as much). I prefer to think of Martin as Tolkein's evil twin: wherein THE LORD OF THE RINGS was ultimately an optimistic, life-affirming journey, A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE is its nihilistic counterpart, determined to present a blood-soaked world where anything and everything can--and will--happen.A DANCE WITH DRAGONS, Book 5, more-or-less occurs simultaneously with Book 4 (though it overtakes it in the last couple hundred pages). We're presented here with characters missing from the previous book: Daenerys, ruling a city besieged by outside armies and murderers within; Jon Snow, Lord Commander of the Watch, slowly beginning to understand the terror that is approaching, and the evils he must face within his own command; Theon Greyjoy, betrayer of the Starks, has become captive of Ramsey Bolton, and lives in quaking fear of his captor's shadow, even as Bolton makes plans to bring rival King Stannis to his knees; Tyrion Lannister, heading across the sea a fugitive and kinslayer, joined with a band of men who are more than they appear; Quentyn Martell, Dornish Prince, on a secret mission of his own. These paths and more will converge, and blood will spill, fire will erupt--and yes, winter is coming.If DRAGONS has a flaw, it's this: by now, there are so many darn characters, it's hard to care about all of them. Martin's world is intricate and well-planned; he covers every detail he possibly can, which can be a bit tedious in spots (okay, a lot of spots). The story has to be this complex, of course--that's what helps ground everything, even the magic, in reality. Thus, it's a forgivable flaw, though readers will certainly find the going a little slow in spots. Tension still mounts, of course--if anything, that's what keeps fans coming back: where is Martin going with this? No one really knows except Martin himself, of course, but we can be certain on one thing: it's not going to be a happily ever after."

(and honestly, because while dating my wife she revealed this as one of her favorite books and that aroused my curiosity.)This is a story that deals with the larger questions of life (and essential truths) and man's place in the world or at least in a challenging situation. So that qualifies as literature according to my wife's definition when I asked her what made literature ""literature"" a while ago.Protagonist Robert Jordan is an American volunteering with the Republicans fighting Franco's Fascists in the Spanish Civil War. A demolitions expert, Jordan's task is to blow a key bridge as part of a larger Republican attack. While waiting with a small band of guerilla's he meets and falls in love with Maria, a victim of the war and symbol for all innocents caught in aggression's path.Thus we have a literary work that addresses commitment to cause, love, and the battle between individual wants and the needs of and obligations to a larger cause.Hemmingway has a way with description and his prose is very well done and evocative - particularly one passage I liked when he described holding Maria's hand with ripening grain in an untrammeled field. His story is slow, however, for my tastes and the descriptions and inner conversations of Jordan are much more prevalent than scenes where anything called action could be said to be occurring (though the action scenes are pretty good when they do occur). I imagine the ending will be unsatisfying to some, but for literary minded folks be the source of discussion as to how the final scene may have played out and what it meant in terms of tying the story's themes together."

Readers see that hatred, loyalty, doubt, atrocity, ideals, and emotional wear were all part of this tragic conflict. The story centers on American volunteer Robert Jordan and his anti-fascist comrades, a band of Spanish Loyalist guerillas operating in the hills behind enemy lines in 1937. Jordan is planning to blow up a Fascist-held bridge as part of an upcoming Loyalist/Republican offensive. His comrades include Pablo, a once-dependable leader now unstable and sick of war, Pilar, a woman of remarkable fiber, and Maria, a victim of fascist atrocities with whom Jordan falls in love. These guerillas hide in the hills while Hitler's bombers fly overhead helping the fascists. Readers learn of atrocities committed by both sides, and see that ideals can die along with those that fall in battle.This 1940 novel makes a powerful statement, despite losing some effect from Hemingway's wordiness and too-lengthy descriptions. Despite this flaw, readers see the cruelties of war, and sense the author's heartsickness at this dreadful conflict."

So, despite the shortcomings of this book, it is still better than many others on the market.A Feast for Crows and A Dance of Dragons should have been ONE book. Had they been edited properly, removing the constant description of nobles and their arms/crests, etc., there would have been an, almost, excellent book.My biggest complaint is the repetitious descriptions and the cliff hangers. Books 1 - 3 were amazing books! They wrapped up some plots while furthering the overarching plot. This book, unfortunately, runs around in circles trying desperately to avoid anything that might have been ""predicted"" by fans. So, where does that leave things? Outrageous, ridiculous occurrences. That's where.If you are a fan of this series, borrow the book from a friend or a library. There are some fantastic parts in it and we can only hope and pray that the next book will come in a timely manner and make a heckuva lot more sense than parts of this one did.As for the treatment of 'main' characters...

This book is written with clear attention to detail and descriptions of what life very well may have been like with a train circus during Prohibition and the Great Depression. In addition to the day-to-day goings on there is the added element of several plot lines of a personal nature with feelings of love, loss, joy and sorrow. Each character is seen from Jacob's point of view and drawn so clearly that you feel you know them personally. I want Jacob to be my friend and so will you!Definitely a book I will be recommending to most everyone! I only wish there had not been the need for a few relatively explicit scenes as those few make this book unsuitable for my 11-year-old. She is a voracious reader and wants to be a writer.

Having read other writers and other Dalrymple books on India before I set out, I read City of Djinns: A Year in Delhi first on my outward journey, and then reviewed it again as we made our way back to Delhi on the last stage of our tour. The book was an invaluable resource, supplementing the ill-informed and poorly spoken guides who were difficult to understand and unable to answer questions in any depth. Dalrymple's book helped me to tie the city and its sites and history together into some sort of coherent whole. I also found the pen-and-ink illustrations by Dalrymple's wife Olivia Fraser very illuminating. Although at first sight they struck me as much too calm and uncluttered to convey the true image of the places they posed, I later came to appreciate how they captured the inherent essence of their subject and spoke volumes in their simple way.As a journalist, Dalrymple has a knack for finding the right people to talk with - people with living memories of the time he writes about, who can bring to life the crumbling ruins they inhabit and instil us with visions of the beauty that once radiated in Delhi. It is certainly difficult to see today but reading the stories did help me to understand the sensibilities of some of the Delhi-wallahs we encountered in our travels.My one criticism of the book is that he reuses material that has appeared elsewhere, which broke the rhythm of my involvement with his story and made me feel uncomfortable. These passages were extensive, and not changed sufficiently to feel new in any way. I was surprised that his editors allowed this to pass, unless there were deadline difficulties.The overall impression that I was left with is that India today is still suffering from the reverberations of the devastation of partition, which brought incomprehensible tragedy and hardship and touched almost every family in India in one way or another. As we watch India vie for its place in the globalised technological marketplace, we will understand her better if we remember this recent back-story in her development."

Being a MacLean fan, but with my current mentality, I figured he had finally run out of ideas (at this point in his life). But the cover of the 1975 Fawcett Crest edition (see ""customer images"" for the paperback edition) was intriguing: a man falling off a high-wire, the bicycle tumbling after him. Is someone killing off circus people? I had to read.It turns out that the circus plays as a backdrop for a secret CIA mission. Believe it or not, but the agenda in this tale is about an incredible circus performer recruited by the CIA to break into a prison (that the circus ""moves"" next to) to steal -- as the back of the book explains -- ""a formula capable of annihilating the earth itself."" Sure enough, MacLean was like the Crichton of the 70s and managed to weave an entertaining yarn around the idea of anti-matter (certainly not new in 1975).MacLean refrains from delving too deeply into describing anti-matter or how this formula will end up being used. His somewhat amusing approach to it takes place as a discussion between semi-ignorant CIA agents and Bruno, the acquired circus performer, all of whom are frightened by the power of anti-particles.As the title may suggest, the book is a slight deviant from other MacLean adventure tales, but I rank it up there among his best works. The book is full of extremely original death scenes that, despite being accustomed to MacLean's formulas, took me completely by surprise. There are more twists in the last chapter than there are in some of his better books, and MacLean pulls it off realistically, and without creating a convoluted mess.Keep an eye out for Carter. While no first name is ever given, he is the doppelganger cameo of Chief Officer John Carter of MacLean's ""The Golden Rendezvous.""

He is truly gifted at writing about advanced science and technology and equally adept at creating &quot;real&quot; characters, because he understands psychology. This is a rare talent: to be scientifically knowledgable and a master at creating believable characters. The books are part action, part scientific explanation (like Michael Crichton of Jurassic Park fame), and part character development.In &quot;Red Mars&quot; (the first in the series) Robinson paints a totally believable picture of what our future might be like as we get ready to explore and colonize Mars. Mega-corporations, earthly power struggles, and the selection process for determining who might get to be the first to go to Mars, are all very possible and Robinson crafts a story around these topics with ease.In the second book, &quot;Green Mars,&quot; Robinson portrays the struggle to get vegetation growing and to create a breathable atmosphere. He also describes more political struggles between those on Earth and those on Mars. This was probably my favorite of the three, but mainly because I am more interested in the science that would be needed in this phase of colonization.In the third book, &quot;Blue Mars,&quot; the planet become more Earth-like. The atmosphere is more developed, water travel becomes possible, and more. (I don't want to give it all away!)The books can be kind of scholarly at times, but I was so impressed with these books that I gave them to my teenage brother. He was so impressed with them, that he gave them to one of his very best pals. And we all had a blast discussing them together. If there is a teenage male in your life -- or if you love sci-fi and have always wondered what it might be like to go to Mars -- then this trilogy is definitely for you. Very highly recommended!"

4,3.4,0.99825,2015,02-12,6816800,Western Sizzlin Steakhouse,Muskogee,,Cal Irvine,East,13,"There's a hilarious scene in Michael Chabon'sWonder Boys: A Novel, in which pothead author Grady Tripp is confronted by his student Hannah Green about his monstrously overdue and overlong manuscript, which she is the first person to have read. Tentatively, she explains that while the first few hundred pages were amazing, he seems to have lost control of the narrative, especially when he gets into lengthy side narratives about the histories of ancient ruins and the genealogies of minor characters' horses.""'Grady,' she said, sounding more than a little horror-struck. 'You have whole chapters that go for thirty and forty pages _with no characters at all_!'""Now, I don't know if George R.R. Martin shares Grady Tripps fondness for the good herb, but he definitely shares the core symptom of not being able to make his story smaller, even when that would make it better. And like Tripp, he has an overwhelming fondness for lengthy asides and genealogies of sometimes terrifying detail - though none yet for horses, thank the Seven.Certainly he remains a productive and very gifted writer. I actually enjoyed A Dance with Dragons more than most reviewers so far. Hence the four stars, which I know I'm going to get reprimanded for despite writing a pretty critical review. But I did enjoy the book! It's mostly quite well-written, and despite the frequent complaint that ""nothing happens,"" is actually packed with events. There are plenty of exciting scenes, some clever plot twists, and a few revelations about ancient mysteries and the motivations of certain key players. The chapters set in the North are particularly good, and I also liked the Tyrion chapters a lot (though I know many other readers did not).The problem is that by the end of the book, the reader feels that the series is no closer to a finale than it was at the beginning. This world Martin's created just seems to get bigger and bigger and bigger, and is now firmly in danger of getting too vast for its own good. And Martin over-indulges in too many of his own equivalents of the genealogies of horses - histories of minor houses, squabbles over tracts of land, and other details that just don't command enough of the reader's emotions.Moreover, many of the newer additions to the population of Essos and Westeros are less interesting than the old ones. I speak of course of the teeming host of Meereenese characters, who all seem have names like Grover zo Snuffleupagus, but whose personalities do not shine through nearly as brightly as their ridiculously colored beards. Martin has an impressive ability to make even his side characters come across as fully-formed people, but with this last book it's pretty clear that he's hit his limit.The first three books of the A Song of Ice and Fire series are about as good as popular fiction gets - whatever the genre. And unlike some, I still hold out hope that Martin can turn the tide and give this series the climax and ending it deserves. But to do that, he's going to have to start making his story smaller rather than bigger, and that's going to require some difficult decisions. But, to quote Hannah Green in the movie of Wonder Boys, that's what writers do. They make decisions.UPDATE: After pondering the book some more, and reading some other reviews by people I respect, I've decided to downgrade this one to three stars. I did enjoy the book in its own right, and continue to think that the frequent complain that ""nothing happens"" is rather ridiculous. But the key problem remains that Martin is not making the difficult decisions needed to bring this series to the lively climax it deserves. And more people are watching now than ever before. He needs to fire his editor and kill or compress about half of his POV characters in order to right the ship, and to do those things he's going to need some friendly but unmerciful feedback."

I reckon those activities would have been more fun and fulfilling.This is a truly bad novel. Truly bad. The writing is amateurish, the dramatic tension poorly developed, the dialogue awful and the character development is shallow and one-dimensional. I could not get over how stilted and poor the writing was. Our newly orphaned hero, Jacob Jankowski, dropped out of Cornell before his final vet exam, jumped a train containing the Benzini Bros travelling circus, got taken on as the circus vet, instantly fell hopelessly in love with one of the married showgirls despite spending barely any time alone with her, took on a cookie-cutter baddie to boot (boo, hiss!) and survived to live happily ever after to a ripe old age. So there's the plot outline, which initially showed some promise. Pity Ms Gruen did very little with it that didn't come across as a below par submission to a Creative Writing 101 Workshop. Probably one of the worst books I've read this decade. Under no circumstances read this poor excuse for a novel. The fact that so many reviewers have given it 5-stars is a mystery on par with the Bermuda Triangle. Is it collective hysteria? I just don't get it."

To be short: the fifth book in the series cannot be compared to the previous four. Sadly, I have to say, ""A Dance with Dragons"" kills almost all the forward momentum of the first four books :-((The following sections contain spoilers, beware.)What's wrong with this book? Almost everything. First of all, it was a very bad idea to go back to the time of the events of ""Feast for Crows"". The first half of the book covers the same period as the ""Feast for Crows"". This part is simply boring. The second half of the book is more interesting but the events we are told about simply do not fit into the big picture. The worst part about ""A Dance with Dragons"" is that almost all the characters lost their wits and their behavior is simply stupid. Let's discuss some details.- Daenerys - the change in her in the book is just nonsense, her decisions are simply stupid; the wise and compassionate future queen of Westeros became a gullible, hysterical, lazy and wanton girl. And Meereen is not interesting, it is simply annoying, all the characters we get to know in this city are selfish and disgusting, and anyway, who cares about the Slavers' Bay? Does it have any connections with the main story? It has none. At least, in the end Daenerys leaves this wretched city...- Quentyn Martell - his story, for me, was the biggest mistake in the whole series. We read a lot about Dorne and the scheming of Doran Martell in the previous book. At the end of the previous book it was revealed that the big secret is that the prince of Dorne is sent to Daenerys. Wow, it could have been interesting... Major spoiler here: all this fuss about Dorne, the sand snakes, Arys Oakheart and so on, what is the result of all this? Quentyn dies without any result whatsoever, he and all the Dornish scheming achieved absolutely nothing! This part is really frustrating because why invest a lot into a detailed, and good story? Just to give an abrupt and stupid ending? I am not against killing off the characters, I was blown away by the Red Wedding, because it made sense, Quentin's story is simply unnecessary.- Prince Aegon - did this new twist in the story add anything to the big picture? No, on the contrary. The more new characters we have, the more likely it becomes that a lot of side stories will not be wrapped up at the end. Are Aegon an his companions interesting characters? Unfortunately, the answer is no. Up until this fifth book Martin managed to avoid most of the fantasy clich&eacute;s, Aegon and his team is simply too bland, and mostly unnecessary and clich&eacute;d (the good but spoilt prince with his loyal and wise counselor is one of the biggest fantasy clich&eacute;). Was the story in such a dire need for another contender for the iron throne?I could continue with all the characters in the book, none of them moved forward. Even Tyrion, who is still the best character in the book, became shallow. And what about this girl dwarf? Really?Yes, I am angry with this book, because the first four books were masterpieces, this one is ordinary. I cannot give it more than two stars."

At times the plot ran so quickly I found myself trying to search for a way to slow down the course of the story, but to no avail. The quick pace, however, does seem to fit and reaches a broader audience that seems to want rapid conclusion and catharsis. Reversions to the present time are a nice break from circus life and I believe are Gruen's most vivid and compelling depictions of the novel. Her illustration of life at the nursing home and perspective of the `patients' which Jacob catches a nurse stating when the correct political term is `residents' provides an accurate and refreshing look at assisted elderly homes. The circus lifestyle is portrayed truthfully, but is often overshadowed by the dynamics and major plot-line concerned with the Romantic relationship and triangle of Jacob, August, and Marlena.Gruen's, ""Water for Elephants"", is an easy read with relatively simple themes and motifs to comprehend including: animal cruelty, abusive relationships, circus life in the 30's, life during the Great Depression, coming of age, and older age/aging. It truly encapsulates a broad range of topics, but the overlaying plot and issues are prevalent and riveting, if a bit rushed."

Some of the research which underpins the book was outstanding. Depression era circuses, train circuses as Ms Gruen calls them, being a hobo on the rails, the brain of an elephant and the thread about Jamaican Ginger - all were fascinating - as was the almost seamless blending of the two time periods. Clearly the lady can absorb large quantities of research information and transform that into an excellent novel. She clearly, and obviously, loves animals.

One of the most believable aspects of the story is the use of Antartica for a training/practice base, prior to the actual mission.Yet, with 2006 hindsight, there are a number of critical situations which don't hold up well 13+ years later... here are a few:1) The year 2027 is overly optimistic for colonization of Mars - mankind will be lucky to have even set foot on Mars by this date, let alone attempt a hugely expensive colonization effort.2) The MARS colony spacecraft is made up of 48 boosted Shuttle upper stages... this is never going to happen - indeed, at this point it is clear that the Space Shuttle won't fly more than a handful more missions... and, certainly, Shuttle upper stages aren't going to be boosted and used for any reason (this upper stage boosting idea seems to have been a pipe dream fantasy of some in the early 90's, and Robinson seems to have fallen in with this group).3) The original 100 member Colony team is made up of almost a 50/50 mix of Americans vs. Russians... realistically, this colonization will likely be made sometime after 2050 by independent Chinese, American, or Indian efforts (with lesser powers Russia, Europe, and likely Japan ""helping"" one or the other of these future superpowers).4) Later colonization participants include a large faction from the Muslim world... again, this is highly unlikely given the current political climate, and a more ""enlightened view"" of the Muslim world.This book is part of a Mars Colonization ""trilogy"", and the last two books, GREEN MARS(1995) and BLUE MARS(1997) won Hugo awards."

What is surprising is that it's only Gruen's third book - with prose like this you would easily expect her to have a dozen or two novels under her belt by now. Couple that with Gruen's attention to detail, which is reflected in her extensive research of the subject. Bet the original publisher who turned this manuscript down for lack of interest is sorry he did so. (Ms. Gruen did herself a favor in finding a new publisher!)I left the book feeling like I was friends with the characters - the cantankerous, honest yet likeable Jacob, the beautiful Marlena, the humourous and captivating Rosie. Rosie easily stole the show - as the title suggests - and you felt a special relationship with her as you went through her trials and tribulations while part of the Benzini Brothers entourage. Her behavior is nothing short of stunning and miraculous towards the end. After the circus' collapse, how can Gruen deliver after such a memorable scene? You'll just have to find out.

Listening to this story is tremendous, as it easily allows for the two voices of Jacob Jenkowski to be clearly heard and distinguished from one another. This book is a love story, a history lesson, a peek into different elements of humanity that have way too much realism. There were times I wanted to skip ahead because I didn't want to hear the unpleasantness taking place in the story. But of course I didn't. Because one has to endure some bad to appreciate the good. The love story is much more too, than a man and a woman - it involves the circus animals and how they instinctively know who is good and who is not. The history lesson reminds us of a lifetime ago, which really isn't so very far away - less than one hundred years, and helps us appreciate how far we have come.

Getting through this dense space opera is no easy task, though. I did it, though, and although I cannot understand why, I want to finish this trilogy, if only to find out how the transformation of Mars in these books is completed, or even if it is managed at all.I found Mr. Robinson's style mind-numbing at times. He must have become an expert in both Martian geology and Martian geography, each specially less likely than the last. I applaud the author's knowledge of Mars, but frankly, I found that often I did not care where on Mars the characters were or what it looked like. His penchant of focusing so closely on description of martian geography took something away from the ""gee-whiz"" adventure of it all.I did enjoy the occasional human drama of the story. Who knew that, if a bunch of brilliant scientists were sent on a Mission from Mars, with little or no reason to listen to their handlers back on Earth, their behavior would resemble that of young teenagers? I enjoyed their occasional broodings, their frequent hysterics, and their abilities to wrangle the simplest matters into the realm of high drama. Perhaps all of that is a function of the author's acumen, but it was fun nevertheless.I wondered quite often at the colony's ability to expand so quickly. The technologies presented near the beginning of the story are recongnizable, and probably a few of them we will have a handle on by the time we are able to journey to Mars, but the technology has gotten way out of reason by the end of the book. I don't think giant domes that can cover an entire martian crater will ever by physically possible, one hundred or five hundred years from now. Physics is physics.Overall, this novel was not a waste of time. I know, that's not a glowing endorsement, but it's all I can give."

A book will become popular and into a popular movie before I read the book. But when I do, I typically enjoy it. Well, I was late with Water for Elephants by Sara Gruen.This is a story, if you didn't already know that, about an old man reminiscing about his life with the circus. Jacob is about to become an official vet during the age of Prohibition. Just as he is about ready to sit down and take his final exams, he is informed that his parents were killed in a car accident and everything had been mortgaged too much. He now is without a family and a home. Instead of taking his exams, he runs off and finds himself on a circus train.Jacob finds himself falling in love with one of the performers who is also the wife of his boss. It all gets ugly as his boss reveals physiological problems resulting in death at times. Jacob develops friends in the most unlikely places including that of a large elephant.Ms. Gruen does an excellent job going back and forth in time as Jacob is an old man dealing with growing old and as a young man not sure who he is or where his future lies. The loneliness of the assisted living is shown with deep emotion, and the dirty side of the glamorous circus is laid out before the reader.This is one of those books that you'll either love or hate. It is not action packed. Most of the action does not occur till very late in the book. The majority of the story is slow as it goes through many of the mental thoughts of Jacob and the detailed life of a circus performer and worker. I found it easy to put down and resume reading at a later time. But I am very glad I read it. It is a good read, but a read that only those that prefer slower, deep readings can enjoy.There is graphic language and scenes that might be offensive to some though they are not many. It is not a pretty story as the life of the circus was hard and dirty. This story depicts a seedy side of the glamor.Ms. Gruen did a great job bringing to life interesting characters that won't soon be forgotten.Note: This book was borrowed by me from the library."
7,3.03,0.99432,2007,08-27,7100200,Planet Smoothie,Clarksville,,Kentucky,West,8,"This is a novel about the Spanish Civi War, specifically the story of an American who works with a group of partisans to sabotage a bridge. The story takes place over three days but the book runs in excess of four hundred pages. As a result, the pace can get slow at times. No background is given on the war, but Hemingway's sympathies are clear: the fascists must be defeated, and the worth of personal sacrifices is determined in how they further the greater good. Hemingway develops some interesting characters, particularly ""Pablo,"" a disillusioned partisan leader whose murderous actions in support of a noble cause lead him to alcoholism and defeatism. The American protagonist is most interesting: a cynic who still believes in a cause outside himself. The romantic relationship between the American and a Spanish girl was not the novel's strength; Hemingway did not make his career drafting love stories. Although a bit slow, some of the scenes are fantastic. In particular, the flashback to the murder of fascist sympathizers in a small village is one of the most horrifying chapters I have ever read. Likewise, an account of a partisan group's last stand on a hilltop puts most Hollywood action movies to shame. Liked the book but did not love it. Probably for people who really dig Hemingway or want a bottom-up look at the Spanish conflict."

It is said that Kahlil spent more than 20 years writing The Prophet and held onto the manuscript for 4 years before finally releasing it for publication. Kahlil referred to The Prophet as the ""strange little book"" or ""the little black book"" in reference to its cover. The working title of this strange little book was ""The Counsels"" - the final version consisting of 26 `verses'.In The Prophet the philosophy of East and West meet in a union unparalleled in the literature of the early 20th century. Kahlil acknowledged that he was inspired by a multitude of writers and that is evident throughout The Prophet. Most notably the visions of William Blake, who Kahlil referred to as ""the poet-prophet par-excellence"" (incidentally one of Kahlil's mentors the sculptor Rodin called Kahlil the 20th century Blake), The Prophet was also heavily influenced by the Bible, Buddhism, Hinduism, the English Romantics, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Walt Whitman, Friedrich Nietzsche, Ameen Rihani, and Christian and Sufi mysticism.When The Prophet was first published the early 20th century critic Claude Bragdon wrote of its, ""extraordinary dramatic power, deep erudition, lightning-like intuition, lyrical lift and metrical mastery with which the message is presented, and the beauty, beauty, beauty, which permeates the entire pattern."" Wow that's a powerful critique...and let's listen to his close friend and one of his biographers Mary Haskell who wrote to Kahlil after she received a copy of The Prophet:""Beloved Kahlil, The Prophet came today, and it did more than realize my hopes. For it seemed in its compacted form to open yet further new doors of desire and imagination in me, and to create about itself the universe in nimbus......This book will be held as one of the treasures of English literature. And in our darkness we will open it to find ourselves again and the heaven and earth within ourselves. Generations will not exhaust it, but instead, generation after generation will find in the book what they would fain be - and it will be better loved as men grow riper and riper. It is the most loving book ever written.""I can add little more than that...other than Haskell had a very good point."

I am unable to comment on all the details that made this book highly enjoyable, but nonetheless I wanted to add my review.One of the first things that piqued my interest was the fact that the main character was 93-years old (or was it 90?) which lent a different perspective to the storyline and resolution. Jaocb, was a very likeable main character in his old age and in his youth, but was not the only character you felt invested in. The character of Walter (Kinko) with this dog Queenie was just as intriguing despite his secondary role in the story. As well, the antagonist, August, was just as aptly developed, which made you fear his anger towards Marlena and Rosie. Speaking of Rosie, as an animal-lover, I cared deeply for her safety and sucess in the future of the circus.I was surprised to find out that the author knew very little about the circus prior to writing this book, but she did an excellent job of researching to pull off a very believable background/setting for this story.The characters live with you long after the story is over and you find yourself wondering what happened to Mr. Jacob Jankowski as he started on a new adventure in his life at 93 (or was it 90?)."

5,3.1,0.9968,1998,05-12,3690800,Christina's Homemade Ice Cream,Cambridge,USD 0.00-25.00,Navy,East,16,"There's a hilarious scene in Michael Chabon'sWonder Boys: A Novel, in which pothead author Grady Tripp is confronted by his student Hannah Green about his monstrously overdue and overlong manuscript, which she is the first person to have read. Tentatively, she explains that while the first few hundred pages were amazing, he seems to have lost control of the narrative, especially when he gets into lengthy side narratives about the histories of ancient ruins and the genealogies of minor characters' horses.""'Grady,' she said, sounding more than a little horror-struck. 'You have whole chapters that go for thirty and forty pages _with no characters at all_!'""Now, I don't know if George R.R. Martin shares Grady Tripps fondness for the good herb, but he definitely shares the core symptom of not being able to make his story smaller, even when that would make it better. And like Tripp, he has an overwhelming fondness for lengthy asides and genealogies of sometimes terrifying detail - though none yet for horses, thank the Seven.Certainly he remains a productive and very gifted writer. I actually enjoyed A Dance with Dragons more than most reviewers so far. Hence the four stars, which I know I'm going to get reprimanded for despite writing a pretty critical review. But I did enjoy the book! It's mostly quite well-written, and despite the frequent complaint that ""nothing happens,"" is actually packed with events. There are plenty of exciting scenes, some clever plot twists, and a few revelations about ancient mysteries and the motivations of certain key players. The chapters set in the North are particularly good, and I also liked the Tyrion chapters a lot (though I know many other readers did not).The problem is that by the end of the book, the reader feels that the series is no closer to a finale than it was at the beginning. This world Martin's created just seems to get bigger and bigger and bigger, and is now firmly in danger of getting too vast for its own good. And Martin over-indulges in too many of his own equivalents of the genealogies of horses - histories of minor houses, squabbles over tracts of land, and other details that just don't command enough of the reader's emotions.Moreover, many of the newer additions to the population of Essos and Westeros are less interesting than the old ones. I speak of course of the teeming host of Meereenese characters, who all seem have names like Grover zo Snuffleupagus, but whose personalities do not shine through nearly as brightly as their ridiculously colored beards. Martin has an impressive ability to make even his side characters come across as fully-formed people, but with this last book it's pretty clear that he's hit his limit.The first three books of the A Song of Ice and Fire series are about as good as popular fiction gets - whatever the genre. And unlike some, I still hold out hope that Martin can turn the tide and give this series the climax and ending it deserves. But to do that, he's going to have to start making his story smaller rather than bigger, and that's going to require some difficult decisions. But, to quote Hannah Green in the movie of Wonder Boys, that's what writers do. They make decisions.UPDATE: After pondering the book some more, and reading some other reviews by people I respect, I've decided to downgrade this one to three stars. I did enjoy the book in its own right, and continue to think that the frequent complain that ""nothing happens"" is rather ridiculous. But the key problem remains that Martin is not making the difficult decisions needed to bring this series to the lively climax it deserves. And more people are watching now than ever before. He needs to fire his editor and kill or compress about half of his POV characters in order to right the ship, and to do those things he's going to need some friendly but unmerciful feedback."

The backdrop is the 1930's, and the book throws you into the era of carnivals, Prohibition, and the Great Depression. You're led by slums with hobos, and everyone is dying for regular pay and something to eat.The story bounces back and forth between a man living out his twilight years in a nursing home, and his 23-year-old self... where circumstances find him joining a circus. Life revolves around the train for these guys - they always travel in cramped space with all kinds of memorable characters.There are some great anecdotes so strange you'd think they were true. My favorite was Rosie the bull elephant sneaking lemonade by pulling her stake out of the ground, and then being smart enough to replace it to avoid getting caught.The author respects the reader enough to let him figure out what's happening from contextual clues. For instance, a show horse is put down, and the starving lions miraculously wind up fed. You have to connect the dots to understand the whole story.Another positive: this book is not a tear-jerker and avoids supernatural components, unlike other popular fiction (e.g. Dean Koontz). Note that there are some graphic sexual encounters and profanity that make this mature with a capital ""M"" - don't give it to anyone younger than a high school kid."

The story is told through the mind of Jacob, a nonogenarian (yes, I had to look that up) resident of a nursing home, who was orphaned his last week of veterinary school. Jacob discovers that his parents, struggling along with everyone else through the end of the Great Depression, had impoverished themselves to keep him in college. Broke himself, and unable to focus enough to complete his exams, he desperately jumps a train and runs away from his life.The train he jumps happens to belong to The Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth. Barely avoiding getting thrown off the train, he is befriended by a few of the circus workers, and becomes the veterinarian for the show's menagerie of exotic animals.This look behind the scenes of the train circuses is enough in itself to carry the book. Sara Gruen's ability to place herself behind the eyes of a 93 (or is it 90?) year-old man is gripping. The two combined give the story a depth that makes you want to keep turning the pages.The flaws in the story are not enough to make it founder but just enough to keep this from being a five-star read. In particular, Jacob's ability to turn his back when those he loves are endangered is at odds with what we see of his nature at other times. The encapsulated explanations for his behavior notwithstanding, his integrity is deeply flawed in a manner that can't be explained away, and yet the author ignores it. We are thus left cheated from seeing not just how Jacob affects the circus, but how deeply the circus affects Jacob."

Touching on scientific, political, and philosophical issues and the points at which they intersect Stanley uses Mars as a backdrop to discuss the human condition and the nature of human society. Stanley's prose brilliantly portrays the stark, claustrophobic enviroment that living on Mars would bring.

Jacob Jankowski is a nintey-something year old man who has been abandoned by his family in a retirement home. One day Jacob sees a circus come to town through the windows in his retirement home. This circus coming to town forces his aging and forgetting mind to remember a time in his life when he had lost everything and ran away to escape it. He ends up jumping onto a circus train and joining the Benzini Brothers as the circus doctor. On his journey he meets many friends and enemies. The story then alternately goes from present day to depression-era 1930s. While he is working for the circus, the ringleader Uncle Al picks up an elephant from another circus who has just gone broke. I absolutely adore the relationship that forms between Jacob and Rosie (the elephant). Anyone who knows me knows how deeply I care about animals. To see this character stand up and take such responsibility for an elephant in the 1930s was nothing short of heartwarming. This is a book that I recommend. This is a book that I was able to breeze through and I was so sad when I turned to the last page. Speaking of the last page, I adored the ending of this book. It was uplifting and it told me that no matter how old you are, you still have room and time to continue chasing your dreams.Something that I noticed at one point in the book was how parallel Jacob's geriatric life was to Rosie's circus life. There was one quote in particular that I wanted to recall, but it was a library book so I didn't dare mark in it and I returned it prior to writing this. It had something to do with Jacob being friendless, in his nursing-home cage, being poked and prodded. The quote that I selected to open the post with also shows that relationship. This was said to Jacob by Rosemary the nurse. However, this could be also said to the awful August who continually expects Rosie to do the tricks that he wants without giving her any indication whatsoever what those tricks are. I'm sure that with a second reading I could pick up on many other things as well.As I was reading about the book online a lot of people had made comparisons to the HBO series Carivale which I never saw. I'm not sure that I could. I found several of the scenes of animal violence hard to read. One scene in particular still haunts me. In this scene two horses throats are slashed very violently.I am intrigued to see what this time period in the circus did look like which is why I am excited for the movie to be released. I am so excited for Hal Holbrook to be the olde Jacob character and I'm a big fan of Reese Witherspoon however, I do not quite agree with Robert Pattinson being cast as a young Jacob. When I read it I imagined more of a James Franco character. However, perhaps R.Patz can step out of his brooding Eddie the Vampire mode and do an excellent job.

7,3.1,0.9902,2010,02-04,13407100,52nd Tofu House,Seattle,,West Virginia,East,2,"'Water for Elephants' provides an insiders peek behind the curtain of a traveling train circus. Anyone who ever went to a circus and played the games on the midway are rubes wanting to be thrilled, enchanted and take leave of reality for a day. The illusion lasts about as long as cloud of cotton candy. The inside story delves into the darker aspects of what makes the circus viable especially during the 1930's Depression era. The reader is introduced to a strict caste system from bosses to performers to roustabouts that determines one's position among a long train of characters. The practice of 'redlighting' is particularly powerful, a Darwinian, survival of the fittest practice where the circus bosses have the used up roustabouts tossed from the train as excess baggage. Our hero is Jacob Jankowski that over the course of only 3 1/2 months joins the circus. As a veternarian he does not fit into the caste system. Through his character we take a journey making allies with unlikely people, finding love and slaying personal deamons."

This was a well written, easy to read book. My edition was 470 pages, and I had it read in 2 days. The story sucks you in pretty well. I even was able to tolerate the romantic parts, and there are lots of them when Robert Jordan falls in love with the young lady Maria. Usually I roll my eyes and skip past the slop, but this was not too bad. The ending at the bridge was extremely well done. When I read about Robert Jordan down there planting his explosives, near panic because he still hears shooting up above, trying to calm himself down, it really did make my own heart beat a little faster. No book has done that to me in a very long time.So here's what I didn't like. First, it seems like two-thirds of the book was a buildup to the attack on the bridge. After a while, I was thinking, get on with it, already. The big one, however, that ruined the book for me, was the last few pages. Robert Jordan blew up the bridge, reunited with what was left of his group, reunited with Maria, and was fleeing, when a tank shell knocked him off his horse and the horse collapsed on top of him, breaking his leg. Now, in this part, Maria is absolutely right. She wants to cut the load off one of the horses and throw Robert Jordan on its back. Sure, his leg was broken.. so what? That's a non-fatal wound. He wasn't losing any blood as far as I could tell from the text. Sure, he probably would have lost his leg, but so what? Better than losing his life. I really hate what he does here. He gives up. He drives Maria away, breaking her heart for life. Then he lies there with a gun, waiting for the enemy so he can go out in a blaze of glory.Maybe Hemingway meant for this to be noble and heroic. Not for me. To me, it was stupid, unnecessary, and downright cowardly. You see, I'm not suicidal, and I can't get past the fact that this joker did not have a fatal injury. He could have lived and escaped. He had done his bit for the cause in blowing up the bridge. He had a woman (Maria) who loved him and was willing to marry him. He had a good, secure job waiting for him back in the States. The only downside for him is that he may have lost one leg. Big deal. To me, in throwing all that away and committing suicide, Robert Jordan ended up a despicable coward. His little suicidal ending may have killed one enemy officer. A suicidal ending like his is appropriate if you are inches from death; better to take one of them with you on the way out. But Robert Jordan was NOT near death! He just had a busted leg. So he's an idiot, and did not deserve Maria's love. The only possible benefit I can see is that maybe, IF he managed to kill that enemy officer, it allowed the group with Maria a little more time to get away. But they were all behind enemy lines anyway, so I'm not sure how much that matters.So, to sum it all up, I really enjoyed this book up to the last few pages. I was so let down by that ending that I took a star off, and I give it 4 out of 5."

5,2.74,0.9908,1998,08-28,7073300,Hometown Buffet,Vancouver,,St Louis,South,10,"I picked up ""Water for Elephants"" on a whim because I liked the title and the premise was cool: Old-timey circus workers rescue a trained elephant from cruelty. I understood that, while the story was fiction, the author did some research and incorporated several real-life incidents. So, based on this, I actually crossed the threshold of a physical Barnes & Noble, picked ""Water for Elephants"" off a wooden shelf, and presented my plastic card to a human cashier. For all this effort, I truly hoped the novel would be superb. In some ways, it was. But overall, no.""Water for Elephants"" is the story of the struggling Benzini Brothers circus, for which the main character and narrator, Jacob Jankowski, works as a veterinarian. Jacob falls in love with Marlena, a kind and beautiful performer. Unfortunately, Marlena is married to the violently temperamental animal trainer, August. When the circus acquires an elephant, Jacob and Marlena struggle together to defend the sweet pachyderm against August's rages. The story divulges the slimy underbelly of circus life, including gross mistreatment of both human workers and animals, right up to the stunning climax when Marlena ends August's reign of terror.Gruen alternates the novel's setting between a contemporary nursing home where 93-year-old Jacob now lives in a state of semi-dementia, and the 1931 traveling circus. In the nursing home, as Jacob waits for his family to escort him to a modern circus, he wafts in and out of lucidity and mentally revisits his old Benzini Brothers days. Although the flashback technique feels a little worn and, in Gruen's hands, contrived, it does set up a finely constructed and sentimental ending, which is one of the novel's strengths.Aside from the tender conclusion, the story itself has other redeeming qualities. The plot is engaging enough to keep you reading, especially as it nears the climax. Also, Gruen exposes the abuses that occurred in depression-era circuses and, which I fear, probably still exist to some extent. Several scenes are emotionally excruciating, but responsible consumers should be aware of ugly realities.Unfortunately, ""Water for Elephants"" also disappoints. First, the characters are shallowly constructed. I didn't walk away with a lasting identification with any of them, and in fact, by the time I wrote this post, I had to look up all of their names. Also, Gruen's writing style is flat and unmemorable. While the premise was promising, her blas&eacute; rendering diminished what might have been a great novel in the hands of a more skilled wordsmith.If you care about animals, you want a good story, and you're not a finicky reader, then step right up! ""Water for Elephants"" will entertain and amaze, and it may even spur you to reconsider your attitude toward traveling animal shows. But if you're hungry for something profound and beautiful, then move along, folks. There are lots of bigger, better shows out there.(You can find more of my book reviews at ninasbookieblog.blogspot.com.)"
7,3.12,0.98944,2013,07-30,6210500,,Tacoma,$$,Missouri,Midwest,9,"WOW. It's been a long time since I read a book this good--I was so sad when it ended! I kept wishing I could share more of Jacob's amazing life--and the ending, what a boffo finish. I would have NEVER guessed that one! This is much beyond a good ""summer read""--how is it this book did not hit #1?? I love historical fiction, and I am usually very 'into' the time period and the 'feel' of the era...this one was particularly evocative; you could swear you smelled the animal cars, the greasy scent of the carnie food, the whiff of the stale sleeping quarters. I could almost feel sweet Rosie's pain at the hands of the cruel August; and when he met his fate, I cheered Rosie like she was a hero (she's an ELEPHANT). What a rich read--if you begin it, make sure you don't need to sleep that night!"
6,3.4,0.99437,2002,10-23,12751400,Savor Cafe,Bay Shore,,Arizona,West,3,"No one has been more adamant about the genius of George R.R. Martin than I have. Sadly, I think he was a little off of his game on this one. Maybe part of the problem was waiting so very long for this book. I may have gotten too much anxiety and expectation built up over the years as I waited for this book to come. Maybe another problem was that it seems this book was a transitional or ""calm-before-the-storm"" type of book. The first three books in this series while having multiple characters and multiple storylines, usually always had at least one important story that came to at least some sort of conclusion at the end of the book. This book was absent of any great climax. I THOUGHT there was one coming that events seemed to be leading up to for most of the book, but that storyline abruptly dies and left me feeling cheated.Don't get me wrong, the book was great! The characters are superb. I've grown to love many of them over the last few books. As always, Martin does a wonderful job of telling a story through the eyes of various characters each in a unique way. Rather than a 3rd person story that gives the readers facts and some insights into a broad range of characters, we see the events unfold via a personal viewpoint of different people. I think it does a better job of drawing the reader in as you experience events through each person's eyes, and feel their emotions as the drama unfolds. Sometimes we get to experience a common event through two different characters' eyes which is quite interesting. One complaint though is that the story is almost getting too big. The author keeps adding more characters, and I'm starting to reach my maximum amount of people that I care to keep track of. Also, some of the names in parts of the story such as Hizdahr Zo Loraq, Skahaz Mo Kandaq, and Reznak Mo Reznak start to run together after awhile.As usual with a Martin book, the world he creates is full of depth and detail. Every kingdom, city, family, etc. has a unique feel. It's so easy to become immersed in the story as if each place were a city that you visit all the time and every character is an old friend you've known all your life.It's surely a sign of good writing if my biggest problem is that I have grown to love the good guys so much and hate the bad guys so much that I'm getting a little impatient waiting for justice to finally come. I find myself continually hoping with each event that THIS is where the tide finally starts to turn, only to have my hopes crushed. If I look at the book as this setting in motion a string of events that will come to climax in the next book, I can be much more forgiving. However, if the storylines continue to veer off in ever-increasing paths with no end in sight, my patience is going to begin to wear thin. I have danced with the dragons long enough. It's time for this song to end and let the final battle begin!"

But that's the beauty of books and individual interpretation - they are your own to make as beautiful as you can imagine, guided only by the artistic mastery of the author.I saw that another individual had given this book 1 star - merely for editing on an E-Book version. Unless every word was morphed and un-readable, I find that slightly harsh to Ms. Gruen.This is a wonderful story, that has moment's similar to the The Notebook and the movie Big Fish. I recommend it for anyone who enjoys historical fiction and romance. It is carefully researched and filled with drama, humor, passion and love."

But MAN why does he inflict this dizzying cast of characters on us and himself. By having so many characters you can only move each one forward a tiny bit per chapter, and the net result is a novel of parts too small that move too slow. I would have much rather seen fewer characters achieve more.It seems like this series is stuck."

The author did a great job developing the characters and the story. I didn't know much about circus life and the story gives the reader a good glimpse of what it was like.

The story is told by an old man looking back on his life in the circus during the Great Depression. As a young man he joins the circus after his parents died in a car accident. There he discovers a whole new and strange world in the small traveling community. He learns the hard work involved in the back scenes of a circus, as well as the harsh and sometimes tragic lives of the workers. It isn't long before he falls in love with the beautiful Marlena, one of the star performers. Things are complicated though. She's already married to the controlling and cruel head animal trainer.Get ready to cheer for the hero, boo the villain and ooh and ahhh at the story that draws you into a bygone time and place.

Jon seemed to be trying to offer neutral advice like a maester might. Also, I wonder if he was trying to get Stannis out of the way by sending him elsewhere. I loved the setting feel of most of the Jon chapters.I'm honestly unsure what I feel about Daenerys' leadership.Theon's story was an amazing chilling description of torture.I identified with Tyrion's cover story strategy, basing it on personal experience he did have, which would help him stay in character and make it plausible.I loved it the way Davos talked trash when speaking the truth at Manderly's court. Heck, a lot of people in that hall were being brutally honest. Even as a Robb fan, Rhaegar Frey had a point with his rant about Robb's poor decisions.The theory that Bloodraven is Bran's guru is obvious when reading that Bran chapter.Obviously, the Ramsay/""Arya"" wedding was a cruel farce, but I liked the detail about how weddings work for followers of the old gods."

It was simultaneously boring, cliched, badly written and trite. Oh and repetitive. The only redeeming feature of the book was the parts where Jacob was an old man. If the author could write like that more consistently then she would be on to something. I cannot figure out why people love this book so much. If you compare it to another recently very popular book, The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, at least that book was riveting, even though it was also not very well written. I am not looking for Faulkner, but if a book is not high literature it should at least have a compelling plot. This book had neither neither good writing style nor an interesting plot.

7,3.2,0.9997,2013,01-31,7333900,Ella's Pizza,Washington,,Harvard,West,14,"Tom Clancy has created several fictional heroes that are at the heart of his many novels. One, of course, is John Patrick Ryan, who has served his country as a Marine, CIA officer, National Security Adviser, and President of the United States. With the exception of Red Storm Rising (a book that is not set in Clancy's &quot;Ryan-verse&quot;), Jack Ryan appears or is talked about in every novel from The Hunt for Red October to The Teeth of the Tiger.The other major character Clancy readers have come to admire is John Clark, a man who works for the other side of the Agency as a paramilitary officer. Whether he is in Colombia using a laser target designator to help bomb a Medellin Cartel member's mansion or leading a multinational antiterrorist team called Rainbow, Clark is the type of man our government needs to use while denying his existence.But John Clark has a past wrapped in mystery, one his family doesn't know much about and is a closely guarded secret. For John Clark was once ex-SEAL John T. Kelly, Vietnam veteran, avid diver and sailor.But when Kelly's girlfriend is brutally murdered by a Baltimore drug lord's henchmen, the otherwise peacable and war-weary Kelly vows revenge. Dispensing his own version of street justice relentlessly and without remorse, Kelly must not only avoid being killed by the drug dealers, but he also has to evade the dogged detective work of Baltimore cop Emmett Ryan, a World War II vet and father of the future President.Adding to his already complicated life, Admiral James Greer recruits Kelly to participate in a daring rescue mission into North Vietnam. But when a radicalized American antiwar activist gets wind of this secret military operation, events will drive John Terence Kelly down a path that he never intended to take.Although published 11 years after The Hunt for Red October, this taut and thrilling novel is the first chapter of the long-running Jack Ryan saga. If you are just entering the Ryan-verse, read this entertaining book first."

There is much and more to like here. But on the little and less side, I have some quibbles.

But I can't help but be disappointed in the failure to give previously detailed characters the smallest of progression, relegating them to the chronic cliche of their theme song (I'm looking at you, Princess Shireen and Patches, oh, oh, oh). People with interesting back story and condition who should have had at least one further part to play to justify their existence. And one newish character with whom we spend a lot of time and learn to care about to some extent, only to have that time seem pointless in the end.

Our hero - Harry Flashman, an officer in the British military - is a self-admitted scoundrel/rascal/cad/rogue - ""his personal character was deplorable, his conduct abandoned, and his talent for mischief apparently inexhaustible."" - and because of his ""self-awareness"" is very likeable. Harry is usually on the run from someone - the law, a jealous husband or some figure of authority - and during his travels meets up with historical figures and stumbles into historical events - usually of the military nature - inadvertently fighting the ""good fight"". And as can be surmised, Harry is never short of female companionship.The stories are told from the fictional ""Flashman Papers"", written by Harry in his twilight years, ""edited"" by the author - including ""footnotes"" which I encourage you to read - and which were ""discovered"" in 1966 - The ""faux"" authenticity only adding to the enjoyment in reading these books.In this volume, a two-parter which chronicles Harry's adventures in 1849-50 and 1875-76, we find our hero in the U.S., mostly in the Wild West, with a few sojourns in New York and Washington, DC. As the title suggests, ""Flashy"" encounters and becomes embroiled in the Native American ""problem"". In the first half of the book he leads a wagon train - actually a bordello on the move - from New Orleans to the west coast. In the second half Harry is enlisted - by President Grant - to aid in the ""negotiations"" with the Sioux Nation - the story climaxing with Custer's Last Stand.In the telling of the story the reader meets a cornucopia of historical figures - U.S. Grant, Sherman, Sheridan, Crazy Horse, Spotted Tail, Mangas Coloradas, Kit Carson, Wild Bill Hickok and of course Custer - just to name a few. And Flashman - true to form - is not only in the midst of the all the action - he's the root cause in some instances - and of course he has more than a few romantic liaisons along the way.If historical novels, with more than a little humor, are your cup of tea, this volume and the Flashman series will suit you perfectly."

I love the characters and they are so well written as to visualize them. I like the use of first person narration of the main character Jacob Jankowski. It is interesting to go from the present to the past, and back. It really integrates the progression of the character rather than a linear progression. I read this book a couple of years ago, but reading it again, I found I couldn't exactly remember the outcome and was like reading it anew. The character of Rosie is one of my favorites, inspite of the fact that she is an Elephant. August is hard to take, yet one can see before it's revealed that he clearly is mentally unwell. The tension of the triangular relationship was reminiscent of the trio in Sophies Choice. Walter the clown and Camel are both very sympathetic characters, though Walter's true nature is revealed slowly from being a crusty, mean spirited person to one with great compassion. The historical details of the depression era and circus life is so well drawn as to feel you have been working on a circus throughout this story.I highly recommend this book."

Jacob Jankowski is presently ninety or ninety-three (he doesn't recall) and living out the end of his life in a nursing home. He has family who visit, but they are busy enough with their own lives that he is largely forgotten. A circus comes to town and Jacob thinks back on his own youthful experiences.I appreciate the story's realistic portrayal of early 20th century circus life. The animals live and work in conditions that are horrific, but at the same time they are the lifeblood of the show next to the human performers and are therefore treated well enough to that extent. The author, Sara Gruen, mentions in an interview that many of the anecdotes in the tale are plucked from real life accounts. (For example, an elephant stealing lemonade from the lemonade stand when no one is looking.) Truth is stranger than fiction, indeed."

Honestly, I had relatively low expectations before reading it. I read A Farewell to Arms and found the terse, repetitive prose and stilted dialogue underwhelming. For Whom the Bell Tolls is superior to A Farewell to Arms in every way. This is a complex novel with some of the most memorable characters in modern literature.This mesmerizing novel neither glorifies war, not does it vilify it. Hemmingway's detached prose is world weary, exposing both sides of the conflict, allowing us to see that war, inevitable and futile, is never simple. Characters on both sides of the conflict struggle with their own fears and regrets. Both sides commit, and are subjected to, the atrocities and horrors of war. As different as each side may think they are from the other, in the end, they are all human and are not as different as they think.For Whom the Bell Tolls is riveting and powerful, easily one of the ten best novels of the 20th century. I can't recommend this book highly enough."

Well, unfortunately, it's not been worth the wait. The characters all seem extremely two dimensional (and it's not just because I'm reading it on a Kindle now,) and it seems to be that GRRM has been concentrating more on the food than on advancing the plotline. Another helping of eel pie, please! Perhaps that's why this book took so long - the author may have been eating around the world rather than writing. Anyway, Daenerys simply wanders around saying ""I'm only a girl"" and does nothing - where's our bold Khaleesi who conquored the Free Cities? ""Jon Snow, you know nothing."" Well, yes, other than how to make a deal. Have to admit, Jon Snow has actually become the most grownup character in this. And my poor Tyrion! For a man who ran Westeros, now doing dog and pig tricks is quite a step down, and his only ambitions appear to be find Tysha and killing his siblings. But unlike before, now he just goes with the flow. Actually, that describes this whole book - everybody goes with the flow, and nobody DOES anything.Ah, well, it could be worse. He could spend the book writing about everybody's dresses and Nynaeve pulling her braid."

It sat on my bookshelf for a while before I cracked the first page and was pleasantly surprised by its ability to keep me utterly engrossed in the story.As a historical fiction piece, Wouk tells the story of a Navy family and their individual lives leading up to the United States' entry into World War II. As the family of five spreads out around the world, their paths continue to cross, keeping their relationships alive and continually gravitating towards one another.Truly an epic tale, Wouk does a magnificent job depicting (in an interesting manner) the historical events, political persuasion, national influence, and social pressures surrounding WWII. You will learn about Hitler, Stalin, Mussolini, Churchill and Roosevelt... Wouk's work is better than any history class I've ever taken.This is an impactful ""must read"" for everyone and at the risk of sounding trite, I would call this book a masterpiece.Have fun,David TobiasRedondo Beach, CA"

I feel like I know Jacob Jankowski - both the younger version in shock from losing his parents, and the older version who hates being treated like an ""invalid"". Unlike some reviewers, I am not old enough to remember the circus coming to town on the train and with a parade. In fact, the circus experience from my childhood was in a large concert venue. Nevertheless, Gruen allows me to imagine the big top in all of its grimy glory and picture all of the alcohol loving workers and performers smuggling their drinks on the train. What a nice escape."

He knows life is about the pleasure and the pain; you can't have one without the other (like good and evil). After a tragic loss, Jacob finds a home with a traveling circus as a veterinarian and along the way he: loses his virginity, makes some true friends, learns some valuable life lessons, and falls in love.

It is written by Herman Wouk based on his wartime experiences and his research.Commander Victor ""Pug"" Henry is considered an officer with a bright future. He is a methodical, careful engineer with ""plenty of blue water"" in his service record. His family consists of his wife, Rhoda, their daughter, Madeleine and two sons, Warren and Byron (Briny).Commander Henry wants nothing more in life but to reach the rank of Captain and command a battleship. He has worked systematically towards this goal for his entire career. Beneath that taciturn exterior is a deep intellect coupled with presence of mind. He has made no missteps in his career. However the next assignment offered to him doesn't thrill him.The U.S. Navy had historically sent it's less promising officers to diplomatic posts. In these days before WWII, this policy is reversed. Pug is offered the post of Naval Attach&eacute; to Germany. This is Germany under Adolf Hitler and the post is considered crucial. However in Pug's eyes, it is possibly a career dead-end. Nonetheless after consulting his socialite wife Rhoda and an Annapolis classmate, he takes the job.Pug's elder son Warren is cut from father's mold career-wise. Like his father, he has excelled at the U.S. Naval Academy. He has chosen aviation as his specialty. The younger son, Byron is another story.Byron is an undisciplined romantic dreamer slacker-type who has somehow made it out of Columbia with a B.A. He also got a reserve naval commission in order to placate his father. When the book begins he is working for a best-selling author, Prof. Aaron Jastrow in Siena, Italy as researcher. It's obvious he has `something' but he lacks that certain spark. This amiable drifter finds direction in his life when he falls in love with Professor Jastrow's niece, Natalie.The romance is complicated by a number of things. She is older. Natalie is in love with someone else, an old money East coast establishment-type diplomat, Leslie Slote. She barely acknowledges Byron's existence. Finally, Natalie is Jewish.The last is a relationship killer in pre-WWII America. At this time, a WASP-Jewish marriage was socially looked down upon. Jews and Gentiles had their own separate worlds.This woman gives Byron from his `spark'. Like his father, Byron Henry gets what he wants......While in Germany, Commander Henry files a report going against conventional wisdom. This report makes its way up through the chain of command to the President of the United States. He returns it with a note to forward Victor Henry's service record.Victor Henry has come to the personal attention of the President of the United States of America.I've only scratched the surface of what happens in this book. This book (and its sequel, ""War and Remembrance"") is about WWII and its effects on this most American family. Mr. Wouk cleverly arranges things in order to involve his characters in the different events and theaters of world as they lead up to Pearl Harbor.Close attention is paid to the Jewish experience in Europe as well as the thoughts, events and personalities of those in the corridors of power.The book is a page-turner. While it is not great literature, it is engrossing and the most painless way I know of to study the events leading up to WWII."

There are so many varied responses to this book that the author must be in heaven to get so many responses to this book.I first heard of this book last spring when a fellow Amazon reviewer told me that I ""just had to read it."" I wasn't that inclined since the price was not favorable and the waiting list at the library was too long. However, in my book club, it was the November book to discuss. So when I saw it on the table at the local bookstore for buy three, get one free, I snapped it up. It is not a decision that I have regretted. It is one of the better entertaining books of fiction that I have read this year, if not one of the best. And I read a lot.There are some disaparities in this book as with others, but I think people tend to forget that a work of fiction is simply that, a work of fiction. Not everything's going to ""mesh together"" as in real life. That's why you read nonfiction if you like everything in its proper place and order. This book is simply a fanastic tale of a man facing the end of his life in a dreary nursing home setting, and reliving some of the best moments of his life. A young orphan who happened to jump the train to get away from the tragedy that was his life happened to be on a circus train. He didn't plan to run away to the circus, he just stumbled on the circus train while grieving. And stayed. Fell in love with the most beautiful girl in the world who is happened to be married to the ringmaster. What a story!This novel alternates between Jacob's present and past ~~ he relives the first three months of being in Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth. Jacob is 90 or 93 (he can't remember which) and seventy years prior, he was the Benzini Brothers' vet, taking care of the underfed animals of that show. He worked with all kinds of people and animals. It was an exciting life ~~ how many people do you know that lived a life like that? Marlena is the wife of the psychotic ringmaster who alternately abused his wife, his animals and co-workers. Rosie is the elephant bull that Uncle Al, the owner of the circus, bought for a song, hoping that Rosie will be the biggest draw to his circus.The descriptions in this novel are lavish. One can see the sawdust in the air as the big top was put up. One can see the cotton candy being spun. One can feel the humiliation of an old man having to take a shower under the watchful eye of the nurse in the nursing home. One can feel his love for the beautiful show girl. And all of this is tied together beautifully, both past and present. It is a glimpse into a life of a man.Why didn't I give it a five star? Simply because I felt that the endings to both stories were rushed. I did not expect it to have such happy endings since the stories were more gritty and realistic. But hey, this is a work of fiction, right?11-4-07"

Just when John is falling in love with Pam and trying to help her change her life, she is brutally murdered by the drug ring that controlled her and other prostitutes like her. Now John must deal with his anger and compounded sadness. How he chooses to deal with it is highly controversial as he uses his extensive military training to hunt down and take out all of those that are involved with Pam's death.At the same time, the war in Vietnam is raging and numerous American soldiers have been taken prisoner in a secret location and reported dead.

Honestly, after hearing some very good reviews about this books (actually, the reviews came to me via a co-worker who pressed a hand to her stomach, frowned and said, ""my daughter and I loved this book"") I figured I would give it a try.The first sign that this was not going to wind up on my favorite book list was that after an hour or so of reading, I realized that I was more than 100 pages in. Normally when I'm reading, I pause occasionally to think, reflect, sympathize, emphasize, synthesize, etc, etc, etc. But alas, nothing deep and worthy of reflection was to be found. Nothing to stop me reading for a moment to think about what I'd just read. Not that I was expecting much, but I find myself more appreciative of a book, story, news article, movie or television show if it can make me think about at least something more than the words in front of my face. Again, not here. There was nothing to be found.Eventually, as the story continued and I learned more about Jacob and the circus, I can't say I was surprised when I found myself not caring one way or the other what was going to happen to him, or the rest of the circus bunch - there was nothing for me to connect myself to these characters with. If anything, the more I read, the more impressed I became with the author's ability to keep me so detached!In addition to the weak and utterly predictable story, (I mean, who didn't see that August was either bi-polar or a schizophrenic, that Marlena was going to get pregnant, or that Jacob's family wasn't going to show?), the dialogue comes out incredibly thin - to the point that I'm actually thinking that the author has never heard two people speak to one another. The dialogue comes across as forced and, for lack of a better term, soap opera-ish. I half expected to hear the dramatic soap opera bumper at the end of each chapter ""will Jacob get the girl, will August find out about their illicit love affair and will Rosie finally learn English? Tune in next chapter..""But I digress. For everything I've stacked in the negative column about this book, there is one redeeming quality - and that is the story. I'm (somewhat) not ashamed to admit that I literally couldn't put this book down. It was like literary candy on a rainy day (actually a smoky day here in So-Cal). I picked up the book at 8am and set it down again around 10pm (having stopped for food, news updates, etc). Needless to say, I was disappointed.Overall, a good book for when you require some mindless entertainment - like sitting in an airport, or on death row.Finally, I was not impressed with the authors use of 'authentic circus lingo.'

But one episode of the series had me hooked and I couldn't wait to immerse myself in the books. I raced through the first four, then had to wait a good while for this one. But oh, my, it was certainly worth it.I've never seen an author who could juggle such a mega-cast of characters and narrative threads and keep the whole thing comprehensible in drop dead exciting. Not only are the existing characters sent off in some very different directions; there a host of new characters and places -- including one young man (who shall remain nameless in this review) who has attracted the loyalty of some surprising people and whose plans could be devastating to this entire world from Westeros to the Slave cities to the Wall -- that is if he can just stay alive that long.I hope I won't be a spoiler by saying that this book, according to the author, is not the last to come in this magnificent series.

George Martin has a way of writing in circles, with the later books hanging around to meet up with his previous book chronologies, which take a certain talent in a writer to pull off well. Ice and fire will go on for a while yet, as George is still formulating this tale in his head as he goes on with it. Not that he is likely to be stressed much, to be able to come up with more intrigueing tales to spin, as he completes the work he has begun here, but rather more like data input into a computer program that combines like proofs to complete a theorm or postulation to lay down his own evolution of his imagination. He does it so well that those of us reading his works anxiously await his outcomes with anticipation that I am sure followed JRR Tolkien's first works of the last century, as the turmoil of Europe gripped the readers he nurtured along after his Triology.

Because he is ""almost"" a vetrenarian they welcome him aboard (although not that nicely or easily) and he quickly becomes embroiled in a very predictable love triangle.Gruen does a great job with the transition from the ruminations of 93 year-old Jacob in the nursing home to 22 year-old Jacob on the traveling circus. They're seemless and very well done. Reading about the circus and life on a traveling circus during the depression era was also interesting.My complaint with the novel lies in the fact that as a reader I felt the author just skimmed the surface with this novel. The story was predictable and shallow, and while the characters were decently developed, the overall story line just wasn't that great, IMHO.I was disappointed."

It may have just been the timing was wrong for me to read this story, but I was not into it (and I find myself rarely disappointed with books). I think there wasn't enough magic in it for me. I didn't see the basis for the romance. Maybe I need to try to pick it up again, but I was left so disappointed that I really don't want to."

It misses the mark by 1 ounce. This book was actually created after The Hunt for Red October and Patriot Games, but is the first in the series. It is- more or less- a prelude to the series. Amazingly enough, Jack Ryan does not play a particuly big role in this book. But none the less, Tom Clancy shows how one man can change from a normal citizen into a cold-blooded killer who will stop at nothing to reach his goal. I suggest this book to anyone who likes Tom Clancy and is willing to devote some time to a book. This is one of my favorite books in the series right next to The Hunt for Red October, which has to be the best. This is just the book to start off the series."

However, the pace is not just slow, it barely moves at all, and the plot gets lost along the way. This is the third time I have tried to read it, and I still couldn't finish -- too boring. There are long, long monologs on the science, and tensions in relationships that keep you hoping for some fireworks that in many cases never materialize.These are the most boring personalities that I have seen in fiction in a long time.

This ""packet"", like its immediate predecessor, acts to fill in a previous ""gap"" in the Flashman timeline. From a chronological standpoint, the adventures of this novel immediately follow those contained in Flash For Freedom, wherein we left Flashman in the port of New Orleans awaiting transport to England. Alas, poor Harry is instead destined for adventures in the American West of 1849-50. The story then skips over 25 years and picks up again with Flashman attending the wedding of his good friend Philip Sheridan in Chicago. From there, our friend Flash hooks up with General George Custer for a leisurely ride through the Black Hills of Dakota and into Montana.As in the previous Flashman novels, our Harry is revealed as the premier coward and opportunist of his era; faults which he quite willingly admits and even boasts of. Much as a prior day Forrest Gump, he has a way of finding himself among the most powerful and famous personages of his era, as he takes part in the great events of the period, in this case meeting a young Geronimo on the Santa Fe Trail, traveling with Kit Carson and riding among the American cavalry at Little Big Horn.Aside from uproarious fun and games, the Flashman series is set against historical events and actually serves as an educational experience.

This is my favorite Hemingway novel (admittedly, I haven't read all of them) and I give it four stars because it deals with Spain and I like the plot. Even so, Hemingway thought he spoke Spanish, which he decidedly did not. Early in the novel, while discussing the procurement of horses, someone says something to which another character says ""Less bad."" I don't know if that's Hemingway, a translator taking this from a Spanish edition or what, but ""menos mal"" does not translate to ""less bad."" It's ""all right,"" ""better yet,"" or whatever phrase makes sense. ""Less bad"" is just wrong.I agree with those who question Hemingway's putative brilliance. I think his life is far more interesting than any of his works that I've read. Still, I enjoyed the plot of this novel."
6,3.25,0.9928,1999,10-01,6439900,Naked Lunch,Herndon,,Detroit,South,12,"I started to feel ""George RR Martin"" fatigue while reading a ""A Feast for Crows."" It seeemed like there was a lot of B-characters, and I felt the writing and plotting had gotten sloppier compared to the first three books. Though I had still been excited about ""A Dance"", when I read all the negative reviews I put off reading it indefinately, until recently when I got to watching the TV series and decided I'd try it. And I have to admit I enjoyed it.That's not to say it doesn't have its slow parts. Reading a 1,000 page book which is part of a series of seven is truly a massive time investment, and things seem to go a lot quicker in Westeros than they do in Essos. At times, I was really wondering why there is no raven system on that giant continent to speed things up, but I did enjoy nearly all the Westeros chapters and characters.I like the complexity of the world Martin creates and the mortality with which he imbues his characters. Sure, he resurrects them sometimes, but I feel like this is never a random turn of the plotwheel. Sometimes, the reason for the surprise is that we were caught up in rumor or deception (a common factor historically). Other times, I feel the character has undergone a metamorphosis, and so it is like we are being introduced to a new character.Some readers have lamented Daenyrus indecisiveness, but it is important to remember she is a just teenage girl, handicapped by her good intentions, and in the corrupting influence of the decadent orient. Who of us who becomes decisive remains that way without relapse? Also, bemoaned is a certain new character who seems minor and random, but, I would say, he is important in that he is both a foil and bridge to Westeros. It would be awkward if Daeny just jumped off her dragon when she got to Westeros and nobody knew her.Others dislike the unresolved plot points, but this is what the next two books are for. Perhaps, a bit could have been cut from this book, but it is still not the infinite series of Robert Jordan and his succesors by any means. If there are some warts on Martin's tomes, show me better. Tolkien is long dead. Marion Zimmer Bradley would have you drowning in a sea of estrogen; her mortality is of greying hairs, her world a subverted one, and most of her characters boring. Let's face it: there is no one better than Martin."

With the recent release of the movie, I decided to pull my copy on loan from my bookshelf and read it before venturing out to the theater to see the movie (or, more likely now, renting it).Water for Elephants is definitely different from the other fiction I normally read. The book takes place after the Great Depression, and Gruen did a lot of research surrounding circuses during that time to influence her book. Many of the chapters began with a picture from circus archives, which really added to the experience of reading the book. I absolutely loved how the chapters alternated between the main character's experience in his early 20's as the circus veterinarian and as a 93-year-old man in a nursing home. It really made me think about the stories of my own grandparents, who are nearing their 90's themselves.The diverse cast of characters in the circus also made the drama of circus life a fascinating read. I had no idea of the caste system in circus life, the treatment of employees and animals alike, and how competitive circus troupes were during this challenging era in U.S. history.I have heard that the book is better than the movie. I admit that I am a bit skeptical about the movie given some of the casting choices for its main characters. But, like any avid book lover, I do intend to see the movie to see how it compares to one of the best books I've read so far this year. I highly recommend this book for those who want a story with adventure, romance, and excitement under the big top."

Literally nothing happens for about 300 pages, until some revolution occurs at the end of the book.Some of the things in the book that annoyed me the most were:-The fact that the majority of the people on Mars are potrayed as mindless followers that absolutely revere the old crusty ""first 100"" colonists.-Bedouins and Sufis on Mars? Come on! Get real!-If you are not an expert on space colonization you will have trouble grasping where the protagonists are, are they inside or outside? Technical names for equipment and habitations are used without being explained, what is a ""mohole""? what is a ""walker""? what is a ""tent""?

I felt that Book 4 was all over the place and I was a bit worried about where the series was going after finishing Book 4. There is still a lot of bouncing around in Book 5, but Martin did a good job of keeping his story lines fairly clear. This was something that I found lacking in Book 4. I feel that he is falling into the same trappings that Robert Jordan fell into with his Wheel of Time series. There are too many characters and there's almost too much going on to keep track of, but to me, that spells out a great series and it means that there will be many more books in this series to enjoy.The plot lines that I am most looking forward to in the next book are: Arya, Tyrion, Cersei, Daenarys, and Jamie and Brienne.Martin is great at delivering shocking twists in his plot lines, and Book 5 proves to be no exception.

I'm no Evelyn Wood, damnit.Anyway, I do enjoy O'Brian's novels, but it just occurred to me that I was laboring through this one a bit. A bit long winded, it seemed.I don't know if it's that I've taken a break and been reading pretty widely of other authors in this genre lately, and it's affected my perceptions, or if it's just not his best work.Don't get me wrong: it's still a good read. O'Brian is arguably the best - or most artistic - in this genre.I prefer that he writes in much the same manner you would see from a book written in the period; it's much more vivid and believable.But it does tend to dwell on what seem like small details at the expense of the overall narrative.He could have either written 500 more pages, or shortened it by 200. But since he did neither, it's lacking.What seems happen here is He bogs down the story with incessant observations of one of the protagonists...then, when you come to a sequence of action, he has to rush through it to get to the other side, and more of the same.It just didn't feel very...fluid, I guess. Like he wanted to get all this stuff in, but wanted to confine the book length, too. And then picked the wrong stuff to skim over.Face it, we buy these for tales of action and adventure, not in depth interpersonal observations.Filling out your characters is all well and good, but it can get in the way, too.Maybe I was just suffering a bout of AASD (American Attention Span Disorder)while chewing through this.

Therefore, I'm somewhat surprised it took me this long to arrive at Herman Wouk. Winds of War is a sweeping, magnificent epic that captured me in a way few novels do.Herman Wouk tells the story of a fictional USN family as the events leading up to America's entry into war cast them hither and yon. London, Berlin, Moscow, Pearl Harbor, New York City, Rome, Manila, and Washington DC all figure prominently as do the leaders of each Axis and Allied country.Having read much about WWII, I especially enjoyed Wouk's flawless chronology and the detail with which it was adorned. Indeed, one could absorb a better understanding of the WWII event timeline from Winds of War than from many non-fictional accounts.I do most of my reading at night before sleep. Winds of War had me looking forward to bedtime on my commute home from work. I loved this book. I loved it's character formation, it's pace, it's geographical range, and it's towering level of suspense.

Neither they nor the patchwork consortium of world powers who sent them could agree why they were there or what they wanted from Mars. To Phyllis, Mars was a geological treasure-trove for commercial usage. To Ann, Mars was a museum of geology to be preserved as much as possible in its natural state. To Sax, it was a laboratory for bioengineering experimentation; to Arkady, a laboratory for social reform. To Nadia, it was the supreme test of her genius for cold-weather engineering. To John Boone, the group's charismatic figurehead, it was the sum of what everyone else wanted it to be: he just wanted the First 100 to stand united. No one knew what Frank Chalmers wanted -- but whatever it was, John Boone stood in his way.Most fans of Red Mars rave about its scientific realism, but I've never cared one way or another about the technicalities of speculating plausible future technologies. Instead, I recommend this book for its broad epic vision, its believably complex political situation, and its portrayal of strong but flawed characters confronting difficult situations with ingenuity, hope, and courage. I particularly like the way Robinson explores the complex relationship between John Boone, the First Man on Mars, and his fame -- between a human being &amp; the legend that arose in his wake. The book isn't perfect -- some things the author seemed to be setting up don't pay off, and I could have done without having the most obnoxious character incessantly identified as a &quot;Christian&quot; -- but it's an absorbing, memorable adventure."

The cover invites you to step right up and look at the shadow side. The title is a subject that the narrator, Jacob, knows far more about than anyone else, having spent years on a circus train. So even the title points to the in-your-face flavor of the story. The characters walk into the story from the rough years of the Great Depression. They all point to the darker side of our nature, while they put on a show that denies the fact. Here we find true grit: the smell of alcohol; the sight of blood; the sound of rage; the feelings of frustration.The plot includes people who grit their teeth and bear the pain. Jacob becomes addicted to his pain through the years. August struggles with mental illness. Marlena presses on in a marriage she doesn't want. A dwarf ekes out a difficult living in a world of rejection. The big boss pushes on to maintain that his world is composed of ""suckers born every minute"". The animals too also bear hardship and abuse from supposed caretakers.The story is energized by a foretaste of rebellion against the oppressive power. This early glimpse kept me moving through the whole story. Note that this is not a happy story. You're not going to read Winnie the Pooh. Sara Gruen finds a silver thread of redemption in the midst of dark clouds in Jacob, albeit a painful thread. It sticks like a tattoo through the years, making Jacob what he is in his nineties, still swinging his fists at enemies long gone. He is isolated, and to battle loneliness takes the only path at the end of the story that he knows.I guess all I wanted was a happier ending."

This book is rich in themes. It is a story about coming of age, circus life, elephants, love, friendships, cruelty, mental illness, dignity, life in an old folks home, and old age itself. Author Sara Gruen has created a world of vivid characters and scenes centering on a traveling circus. Life in this environment can be harsh and cruel, but it also has a glamorous side and a close-knit community in which decency sometimes prevails. The reader will feel the chill of despair and revulsion, but also the emotions that warm one's heart. So much goes on in Water for Elephants that I will not begin to describe the plot or all the characters. Everything is unforgettable and I find myself wondering what happened where the story left off because there is a lot more to tell. I doubt Gruen will write a sequel, but I will eagerly await one if she does."

One, of course, is John Patrick Ryan, who has served his country as a Marine, CIA officer, National Security Adviser, and President of the United States. With the exception of Red Storm Rising (a book that is not set in Clancy's &quot;Ryan-verse&quot;), Jack Ryan appears or is talked about in every novel from The Hunt for Red October to The Teeth of the Tiger.The other major character Clancy readers have come to admire is John Clark, a man who works for the other side of the Agency as a paramilitary officer. Whether he is in Colombia using a laser target designator to help bomb a Medellin Cartel member's mansion or leading a multinational antiterrorist team called Rainbow, Clark is the type of man our government needs to use while denying his existence.But John Clark has a past wrapped in mystery, one his family doesn't know much about and is a closely guarded secret. For John Clark was once ex-SEAL John T. Kelly, Vietnam veteran, avid diver and sailor.But when Kelly's girlfriend is brutally murdered by a Baltimore drug lord's henchmen, the otherwise peacable and war-weary Kelly vows revenge. Dispensing his own version of street justice relentlessly and without remorse, Kelly must not only avoid being killed by the drug dealers, but he also has to evade the dogged detective work of Baltimore cop Emmett Ryan, a World War II vet and father of the future President.Adding to his already complicated life, Admiral James Greer recruits Kelly to participate in a daring rescue mission into North Vietnam. But when a radicalized American antiwar activist gets wind of this secret military operation, events will drive John Terence Kelly down a path that he never intended to take.Although published 11 years after The Hunt for Red October, this taut and thrilling novel is the first chapter of the long-running Jack Ryan saga. If you are just entering the Ryan-verse, read this entertaining book first."

It's shocking that this is what has become of American literature. It's the Oprah factor. ""Oh, isn't it so romantic that this guy makes out with the bad guy's wife while the bad guy beats the elephant with a stick with a nail in it."" This guy allows the elephant to be beaten on a daily basis and he's a vet and he does nothing. I don't know, maybe in the shocking ending we find out that this wimp didn't really exist or something like that, but I couldn't read another page where this ineffectual non-hero continued to do absolutely nothing. Zero. Just imagine ""Grapes of Wrath"" except Tom Joad turns a blind eye to workers being beaten so he can sneak around with a married woman and call her by her first name in 90% of the sentences in which he speaks to her.If you love animals of any kind, you will hate this protagonist.

Everything good that could happen, did! I'm not opposed to that. It just seemed a bit much. Too simplisic. Even the ultimate solution for old Jacob was just strangely perfect and therefore hard to believe.A logical question that bugged me about the plot was why did Uncle Al not get rid of the schizophrenic August? And how in the world did August get to be in charge of the animals in the first place? He wasn't good with them. Jacob or the other Polish worker would have been much more effective training Rosie. If Uncle Al had ditched August, the inflammatory situation between him, Marlena, and Jacob would have been defused.When Jacob was scooping up Rosie and the liberty horses, I was silently pleading 'Don't forget BoBo.'

I have read all these books together in the past month or so and this was the first book that I actually skimmed through a few chapters. I know Feast for Crows got really mixed reviews but I still highly enjoyed it anyway. But this book actually has a chapter that we've already read from Crows in here but it's Jon's point of view not Sam's. I thought that was a real waste of space. And I don't care for Vitarion and I thought there was useless time spent on the Dornish men here. I've read that Crows and Dragons was originally one book but GRRM broke it up into two planing that Dragons would come out within the year of Crows and it never happened that way because GRRM decided to rewrite Dragons. My feeling is he probably shouldn't have done that. Oh well. There is usually a dud in every batch. Hopefully the next book does not take any where near as long to come out. I still can't wait to read it.

He needs them now more than ever to get him through the declining life he lives out in a nursing home. The story portrayed a difficult, sad, evil circus environment where animals were mistreated by men who mistreated each other as well, I guess to survive the depression. I wanted more from the story than its hopeful ending. I wanted throughout to be lifted above its base struggles. I want more vivid descriptions of scenes and increased depth to the characters. What Jacob, like so many in nursing homes needed most was the comfort of family, friends, and staff to listen, to care. A well written book with depressing undertones."

Some deeply moving, others barely creating or leaving the slightest ripple in my conscious brain. Some, seemingly, with the power to change the way I see things or think about things...sometimes subtly, and in others there are major thought differences after finishing the book. This book has affected me deeply.The last book to touch me this way was some months back when I read ""The Piano Shop on the Left Bank"" by Thad CarhartThe Piano Shop on the Left Bank: Discovering a Forgotten Passion in a Paris Atelierwhich I heartily recommend to you.With ""Water for Elephants"" Sara Gruen creates the long-forgotten days of the Train Circus, and all that life entailed in those days...from the impossible ""set-ups"", ""knock-downs"", and in many cases ""hasty retreats"" from any particular chosen town before the authorities arrived upon the scene.""Hard Luck Days"" certainly would be a fitting genre to place this awesome story into. And, of course, with the depression, etc., they truly were hard luck days, for everyone involved with the exception of perhaps Uncle Al with his penchant for stealing, skimming, using and abusing everyone on the show. We also come to know August and his sickness that continually creates misery and unhappiness both for him, and also for those closest to him. There is Marlena, August's wife and performing partner with her performing horses, and later her act with Rosie the Elephant (a charming, and all-knowing wonderful beast if ever there was one). There are dozens and dozens of other characters, distributed throughout all levels of the show, from performers right on down to the dung-shovelers and the guys who do nothing but put up and take down the tents for the big top, day in and day out endlessly, working like dogs for sometimes nothing. We meet the midget clown Kinko also known as Walter and are shown into his rather twisted life, and also we meet Camel, an unfortunate, for sure, addicted to and dying from Jamaican ginger paralysis, a common and cruel death from drinking bad alcohol. We meet and deal with the sadistic Blackie, and witness his ways with dealing with those ""done with"" on the traveling show.Sara Gruen has created a most wonderfully ""real"" environment and ""time"" for this story to inhabit, one that clearly allows one to ""see"", ""feel"", ""smell"" and ""witness"" at what seems ""first hand"" how life was for those who lived ""the Big Top life""....a marvelous talent for a writer. If she were never to write another story, this one, surely, would guarantee her a place in the literary hall of fame....a beautiful, touching, funny, serious, deeply moving look at circus life in the 30's, and also a peek today into Jacob Jankowski's life as it is, and luckily, also, what it is about to become again.Truly, this is one of the Finest books that I have had the pleasure to read....a Perfect 10!Incidentally, Sara Gruen's new book is coming out within a couple weeks, titled ""Ape House"". Luckily I received an advance copy from the Vine Program to read and review, and I will be starting it just as soon as I finish here with this review of ""Water for Elephants"".Sara Gruen....You may never read this, but I wish to Thank You, personally, for giving us this truly Lovely, Wonderfully Entertaining book.

6,3.02,0.9944,1998,04-30,5121200,Pizza Pro,Fairhope,,South Carolina St,South,15,"I like this Hemingway book even better than A Farewell to Arms. It ""stayed with me"" long after I had forgotten most of the details. I read the book as a university freshman, then reread it after it came strongly to mind in summer 1987. I was standing on a steep, green meadow in Schwarzwald, reshuffling the deck of life. Like a Hemingway character, I was traveling around Europe living an adventure.Descriptions of many scenes are memorable. Reading as a twenty year old, dynamiting the bridge and the part where Maria crawls under the blanket with Robert Jordan were the strongest. One still likes those descriptions twenty-five years later, but one then also pays attention to the long description of old dead roses as the essence of the odor of death. And one never forgets the powerful ending. Here's how I remembered the ending before rereading it yesterday: Robert Jordan, mortally wounded, sends the pregnant Maria toward safety with the rest of his escaping band of comrades. Lying on his stomach on the steep meadow, as Franco's fascist troops come up the hillside into sight, he pulls back the bolt and takes a bead on the lead officer on horseback ....Because all dialogues in the book should take place in Spanish, Hemingway wrote partly in the early seventeenth century English of John Donne (readers familiar with the king James Version of the Bible, translated early in the seventeenth century, will easily recognize the language). This has the advantage of giving the reader the sensation of reading 'not-English'.It's still a very powerful book. In the context of history, Hemingway was impregnated with the Teddy Roosevelt brand of heroism."

It's an incredible book; brilliant, educational [to an extent] and highly entertaining. By page ten I was hopelessly lost in its story, and fought sleep to stay awake and finish it.The story is told from the view point of a man named Jacob. His viewpoint alternates between present time, where he is an elderly man in his 90's, in an assisted living facility which he despises, and also from the past perspective, as he recalls his days as part of a train circus in the 1930's. When young Jacob's life turns upside down, he jumps a train, not realizing which particular train he jumped--and his world is changed forever.The story has a bit of everything; history, romance, animals, mental illness, corruption...its all in there, and its all in there in a way which leaves you incapable of putting the book down. I learned a lot of things I didn't know before reading this book. The intelligence of elephants is far higher than I ever gave them credit for. I learned about the epidemic of ""Jake Leg,"" which afflicted thousands of lower class folks in the 1930's. Not to mention how much I learned about the inner working of the train circus industry.At the end of the story is a note from the author, which for that alone the book is worth reading. Sara Gruen is very insightful and passionate, and I have a great deal of respect for her as a person and an author now.My words aren't doing this story any justice. There's so much to it.

6,3.2,0.99538,1991,02-14,8207300,Cafe Sevilla & Tapas Bar of Riverside,Riverside,,USC,Southeast,10,"""For Whom The Bell Tolls"" has long been my favorite Ernest Hemingway novel. A compelling action adventure, this is a tale filled with mystery and suspense, peopled by a cast of extraordinarily vivid characters. It is also the author's finest, and most emotional love story. Although his use of language seems simple, it is deceptively so. Hemingway deals effectively with broad themes here - love, loyalty, trust, courage and honor are some. And of course, ""For Whom The Bell Tolls,"" set against the brutal violence of the Spanish Civil War, is probably the definitive work of fiction about this pivotal period in European, and world history.Generalissimo Francisco Franco's fascist troops invaded Spain in July 1936 in order to overthrow the newly established Republic headed by the Popular Front, (composed of liberal democrats, socialists, anarchists, trade unionists, communists and secularists. (If I have left anyone out, I am sorry - this was a truly complex and unique political situation.)The country was basically divided into Red Spain - the Republicans, and Black Spain, represented by the landed elite, committed to a feudal system and Franco's cause, Fascists, the urban bourgeoisie, the Roman Catholic Church, and other conservative sectors. The number of casualties is only an estimate, but suggests that between 500,000 and 1,000,000 people were killed. Many of these deaths, however, were not the results of military battles, but the outcome of brutal mass executions perpetrated by both sides.During the war in Spain, 2,800 American volunteers took up arms to defend the Republican cause against Franco, who was aided by Hitler and Mussolini. Those who fought with the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, from 1937 through 1938, believed the defense of the Republic represented the last hope of stopping the spread of international fascism. These Americans fought alongside approximately 35,000 anti-fascists from fifty-two countries. Most of the volunteers were not political, but idealists who were determined to ""make Madrid the tomb of fascism."" Hemingway's protagonist Robert Jordan, an American professor of Spanish from Missoula, Montana, was one such volunteer.Robert Jordan, an explosives expert, has been ordered to make contact with a small band of partisan fighters in the Guadarrama Mountains of fascist controlled southern Spain. His mission, of critical importance, is to blow up a bridge, at a specific time, to facilitate a simultaneous Republican attack on the city of Segovia. Most of the novel deals with Jordan's relationships with members of the guerilla fighters, including the girl Maria with whom he falls in love. Jordan is described as, ""a young American of slight political development, but a great way with the Spaniards and a fine 'partizan' record."" Neither a Communist nor a Marxist, he is anti-fascist. As is the case with most foreign fighters, he is under Communist discipline/direction, because, in the conduct of the war, they eventually run the ""show"" and provide the most effective opposition.Pablo is ostensibly the band's military leader. He has become disillusioned with the fight, cynical and bitter. He is no longer willing to die for any cause. A smart man, but brutal, and cunning in a mean way, he is a complex character. He does have a conscience. Pablo spends much of his time in an alcoholic stupor. When Robert Jordon enters the picture, Pablo's level of animosity reaches new heights, and his comrades, along with Robert, are afraid he will sabotage the mission. He undergoes several changes during the 3 days and 3 nights in which the story takes place.Pilar is Pablo's woman, an extremely strong and savvy person, she is steeped in gypsy lore and superstition, and is probably the novel's most colorful character. She is a fine warrior who can be counted upon to cover one's back in battle. Pilar possesses a big heart. She has cared for Maria and brought the girl back to health. When Robert Jordon joins them, Pilar takes the leadership position over from Pablo, whom she no longer trusts, but still loves. She commands the allegiance of the guerrilla fighters and organizes them into a temporary alliance with ""El Sordo,"" another exceptional character. She is the force behind many of the novel's events - stimulating movement, motivating or manipulating people to take action - but for good purpose. Pilar, relates various war stories, and anecdotes, which reflect the cruelty and inhumanity of civil war.Mar&iacute;a's life was shattered by the outbreak of the war. Her father, the mayor, along with her mother, and many of the local citizenry were shot before her eyes by the invading Fascists. Since her mother was not a Republican, but a devout Catholic, she shouted, ""Viva my husband, the town's mayor,"" before she died, rather than the more typical, ""Viva La Republica!"" Maria was then taken away and brutalized, physically and emotionally, by Franco's soldiers. When the guerilla band blew up the train on which Maria was a prisoner, they carried the dazed and broken girl to their mountain hideaway.A thrilling subplot is developed when Andr&eacute;s, a guerilla, must take an urgent message across the lines to a Republican general. Roberto's entire mission, and much more importantly, the offensive, depends upon the successful and timely delivery of the dispatch. Another important character is old Anselmo, for whom Robert develops a strong attachment.A major portion of the novel is told through the thoughts of Robert Jordan, with flashbacks to meetings with Russians in Madrid, and some reflections on his father and grandfather. Jordon's inner monologues fascinate and clearly demonstrate Hemingway's skill with language and character development. Jordan, at one point comments to himself, that he is his own best companion. Because of his wartime responsibilities, he cannot allow himself to be overcome by emotion, which he considers a luxury. Whenever he feels anger, deep love, disappointment, foreboding, fear, anything that will distract him from his purpose, he talks himself down and refocuses. In such a relatively brief period, he begins to love life as never before, because of his feelings for Maria. Even here, however, he accepts that if anything happens to him, he is fortunate to have experienced a lifetime in three and a half days.Again, I cannot write enough in praise of Hemingway's use of language. It is sparse, direct, and extremely beautiful in its descriptiveness. He translated the Spanish intimate ""tu"" form into English. I speak Spanish, and although this may seem a bit awkward initially, it gives a much more accurate feel for the local idiom and the dialogue between Maria and Roberto, (as he is called), and between Roberto and the partisans.This is not only an extraordinary novel, but is one of the most important in American fiction. Hemingway worked as a correspondent in Spain during the Civil War, as a reporter for the North American Newspaper Alliance (NANA). He raised money for the Republicans in their struggle against the Nationalists under General Francisco Franco.JANA"

For Jacob Jankowski, the circus is just about a last chance that fate has given him after some untimely luck. Joining with the Benzini Brothers to care for their animals, Jacob is launched into a world that's strange and unusual for him, and provides the backdrop for reminiscing when he's 90 and in a nursing home many years later.With vivid imagery, you're taken into the world of the circus and into the lives of these characters. The characters themselves are very believable and fleshed out, especially August the animal trainer. His viciousness and mood swings were gripping and his evolution into the bad guy had me sitting there waiting for more. And as the husband of Marlena, Jacob's romantic interest, August had plenty of opportunity to be jealous and controlling. Even secondary characters were well formed and fleshed out, giving the book even more life and character. Even Rosie the elephant becomes a character that you fall in love with by the end of the book.The author tackles a bunch of interesting subjects and has obviously researched them all thoroughly. From the drinking of Sterno fluid during Prohibition and its effects afterwards to the history of the circus originally as an event for men to get on with their hoochy koochy stuff, Gruen provides a well researched take on everything. This research shows and if you're a history nut like me you will not be disappointed.What I had a slight problem with was the love story. It was very sweet, but it was also somewhat stereotypical. Boy comes along and becomes the knight in shining armor to the damsel in distress. It was still a believable, romantic, and heartwarming love story, and it makes you remember that back in the day, people thought that women were property of men. Even in the circus with people protecting one another there was no escape from domestic violence.The story in the past and in the nursing home blended seamlessly and the transitions were impeccable. Gruen crafted a well researched and well written love story that, though with its small faults, was a very good novel. Gruen is definitely an author that I want to watch and read more of.VERDICT: Even though it suffers from a stereotypical romance, WATER FOR ELEPHANTS is a well-crafted, heartwarming novel that keeps you glued to your seat wanting more of the circus and the atmosphere."

That's the word that comes to mind when I think about Kim Stanley Robinson sitting down one day and saying, ""hmmm, I think I'll write a detailed, scientifically rigorous, realistic book (actually trilogy) about the human colonization of another planet -specifically, Mars. And besides the science and technology of it, I'll basically write a 'how to' guide, listing all the potential problems, in terms of politics, philosophy, economics, sociology, ecology, and human psychology. Finally, I'll explore how developments on Earth affect the Martian colonization effort, and vice versa. And, finally, I'll make all this both intelligent enough to be read by a scientist and understandable (and entertaining) enough for the average reader. No problem! &quot;And somehow, for the most part, Kim Stanley Robinson pulls it off. Sure, the characters can be one-dimensional and even grating and annoying, the plot can get confusing (and melodramatic at times - epic upheaval, rivalries, loves, friendships forming and falling to pieces - yikes, sounds like a bad romance novel!), and the whole book sometimes feels like it's about to come crashing down like the space elevator (Robinson is NOT a great narrative writer, that's for sure!), but still....what a vision, what an ambitious undertaking, what a tremendous amount of research obviously went into this, and what a fascinating subject! This is true SCIENCE fiction, and a credible vision (even a blueprint) for what human colonization of Mars (and the future of Earth) could be like in the not-too-distant future. Personally, after reading (I admit, sometimes it felt like slogging through) this book, I now believe that human colonization of Mars is realistic, not just a dream, and with technology now in existence, under development, or within our g rasp in the coming decades (nanotechnology, biotechnology, materials science, etc.) Finally, after reading ""Red Mars"" I came to believe that is not only FEASIBLE to colonize Mars, but probably (I still have my doubts, especially if we just make the same mistakes we have made in screwing up the Earth) WORTH it as well.My major problems with ""Red Mars"": the characters can be cardboard/one-dimensional, annoying, stereotypical (i.e. Sax - the brilliant, rational, but passionless, at least on the surface, scientist; Ann - the moody, emotional, also brilliant in her own way, ""Red Mars"" purist ; Hiroko - the mysterious Japanese ""Green Mars"" cult figure; John Boone - the politician, etc.; Coyote -- the mysterious revoluationary/anarchist), and even laughable at times; the plot can get very confusing, especially with its cast of thousands and its unfamiliar places and names (more and better maps, plus a top-notch appendix, would have been extremely helpful!); things can get repetitive (how many times can we hear the same basic Red/Green argument, for instance, without getting sick of it?), and the writing style can be dry (LOTS of technobabble), humorless, and verrrry slow, and also so predictable at times you can see things coming 50 pages away.Is this great fiction? Definitely not -- in fact it's pretty bad at times! Is this a great book? Well, I wouldn't go THAT far! Is this a great accomplishment? Well, yes, most definitely! If you're at all interested in space exploration, and specifically Mars, I strongly recommend that you read this book. After reading ""Red Mars,"" I'm ready to sign up for the first mission to Mars - when do we leave?"

I actually re-read the first four books before reading this one, so it was a big chunk of reading. Yes, lots didn't happen during it; there were slow interludes. But some stuff does and so I was okay with the book until the ending.So as not to give away spoilers - it felt like Martin had no idea what to do next to get his characters moving forward, so he shook the snow globe up or if you prefer knocked over the game table. And he didn't do it cleverly. He just said ""hmmm, no idea where to go so let's just abruptly do a bunch of things to disrupt stuff.""Really wondering about the characters we've come to know and in many cases admire against our will. Will there be a whole new set next book?And by the way - very tired of the way Cersei is being portrayed. She's written as a dumb blond, prey to her emotions, sluttish, power grabbing, whatever. Yet somehow she keeps ending up winning, more or less. I think he should portray her as a lot more clever than he does and stop heaping so much scorn on her.Anyway, I really thought this was going to be the last book when I got it. But guess not. Will I read the next one? probably, assuming I'm not dead by the time it comes out or that I haven't totally forgotten about the series (it took seeing previews of the TV show to remind me of the book series and finally got me to check to see if there was a new one out)."

When he was 23, he was poised to become a veterinarian. However, fate stepped in and he left school. He ended up joining a traveling circus, where he assisted with the menagerie. During this time, he falls in love with Marlena, who is a performer in the show and also married to the ringleader.I will say that Gruen is gifted in her ability to create imagery. You can see the animals and feel the angst that the circus employees go through under their sadistic leaders. That being said, I can't say that Marlena is a well-developed character. I don't feel as though we know why Jacob fell in love with her, beyond the fact that she was beautiful and cared about her animals. It feels as though that part of the story was left out.And why is August, Marlena's husband, so evil? It does sound as though he suffers from some mental issues, but what is the background on him?I just couldn't fall in love with these characters nor the story."

There are serious weaknesses, though, which are very irritating. Compared to all the prattle about his falling in love at first sight with a woman, there's not much in this book about this veterinarian's love for animals. He just has a dim realization that he's got to take care of them because in the midst of all the cruelty, he's all they've got. The end of this vets years in the circus are compressed too much, so the book switches from very great detail of his life as a young man, all of a sudden, to his life as an ancient in a nursing home!I am an animal lover, and felt cheated that this circus based book was just another love story, and all about the people. There are some remarkable strenghts, too..Ms. Gruen's description of the elderly in assisted living is brilliant and moving.

And I devoured the first four books in about a week and a half, at the same time re-reading the Black Company series from the beginning even as I was in the middle of She is the Darkness. To say I like this particular genre would be an understatement.I fell in love with the series. And that's been rare and rarer occurrence in recent years. Truth be told, in fantasy genre, there are a lot of trash out there. But when you love the genre, you wade through them in hopes of finding something like this series. Even with the good books, after so many of them in so many years, they don't touch you as the early ones once did. But this one certainly did. I cannot even remember being as horrified and actually ANGRY at the villains as I was when I was reading through the Red Wedding. When you're as jaded as I conceit myself to be, that's a treat indeed.So this book was a huge disappointment. In fact, this seems another Wheel of Time in the making. At the risk of sounding snobbish, that's not a compliment. Maybe the author doesn't mind. Churning books is lucrative, and as people invest in characters, they forgive much and dutifully buy the next installment. but if you can't tell a story in about three books (the LotR standard), maybe you shouldn't write. (I know, the Black Company is like 7 books long but the change of POV narrator keeps the books pretty fresh)This book goes nowhere in particular, stews like the thin broth the starving masses (and there are many in this book) huddle around, and dissolves into a cliffhanger that actually gives no suspense.Bear with me for a sec. Parents who prep the young ones for daycare in the morning may be familiar with an educational PBS program called Between the Lions. One of the skits is a crudely animated short called ""Cliffhanger"" where a mountaineer perpetually hangs from a stunted tree limp on a cliff. Each episode, he contrives a way to be rescued and in the end, he still ends up hanging from the cliff. The music concludes, ""Cliiiif hanger, hanging from the cliff. That's why he's named... Cliff Hanger!""That's this book.However, I will grant the maps in the beginning of the book are drawn much nicer.I'll finish this series, no doubt. And it can be redeemed with the resolution in the next book. But I finish all my series, even the foul, unreadable ones. (see my Ed Greenwood book review)"

Older authors tend to utilize a wider range of the English vocabulary even at the expense of being a bit verbose. Newer writers are often times more succinct but also utilize a vary narrow vocabulary to explain ideas, create characters and develop stories. Herman Wouk falls into the former category. His use of the English language is beautiful in a way that is lost in so many newer novels. His work has a similar style to other greats like Somerset Maugham, Pat Conroy, and James Michener. Particularly in Winds Of War he demonstrates his ability to maintain intricate stories with a diverse set of characters from all over the world into a cohesive plot-line. And he does it with relish. With an expansive vocabulary he can entertain the reader with words and ideas that other authors could never imagine writing. Although Winds Of War may contain more factual information that expected, it certainly adds to the authenticity of the story weaved through the timeless characters. Wouk is an exhaustive researcher and the quality of the detailed information rivals any textbook on WWII.I was never interested in WWII until I found this old book sitting on a shelf in our library. Now that I understand the magnitude of the effect the world war had on so many lives from so many countries and for so long, I appreciate this period in history. There may not be another book in print better at engaging a reader into subtle interest in such a seemingly mundane topic.The many rewards Wouk received during his lifetime as an author were much deserved. I hope this novel can help more people who are disinterested in the history of WWII appreciate the time-period."

Being a MacLean fan, but with my current mentality, I figured he had finally run out of ideas (at this point in his life). But the cover of the 1975 Fawcett Crest edition (see ""customer images"" for the paperback edition) was intriguing: a man falling off a high-wire, the bicycle tumbling after him. Is someone killing off circus people? I had to read.It turns out that the circus plays as a backdrop for a secret CIA mission. Believe it or not, but the agenda in this tale is about an incredible circus performer recruited by the CIA to break into a prison (that the circus ""moves"" next to) to steal -- as the back of the book explains -- ""a formula capable of annihilating the earth itself."" Sure enough, MacLean was like the Crichton of the 70s and managed to weave an entertaining yarn around the idea of anti-matter (certainly not new in 1975).MacLean refrains from delving too deeply into describing anti-matter or how this formula will end up being used. His somewhat amusing approach to it takes place as a discussion between semi-ignorant CIA agents and Bruno, the acquired circus performer, all of whom are frightened by the power of anti-particles.As the title may suggest, the book is a slight deviant from other MacLean adventure tales, but I rank it up there among his best works. The book is full of extremely original death scenes that, despite being accustomed to MacLean's formulas, took me completely by surprise. There are more twists in the last chapter than there are in some of his better books, and MacLean pulls it off realistically, and without creating a convoluted mess.Keep an eye out for Carter. While no first name is ever given, he is the doppelganger cameo of Chief Officer John Carter of MacLean's ""The Golden Rendezvous.""

My wife is the true reader of the family and wanted to read the book before seeing the movie in theaters. I downloaded it for her and found myself sitting around bored and started reading it myself. I was instantly hooked. The reason I wasn't interested in it was because I thought it was a romance book. And, I guess, in a way it is. But for me it was more about a romance with the circus. Who doesn't love the circus? Especially, the old train circuses. I spent the first several chapters totally oblivious to my surroundings as I read about Jacob and how this whole journey started for him. I loved the chapters devoted to him as an elderly man and how the author enveloped me into his frailty almost to the point that I felt like I was jerked away when the story switched back to his time at the circus. The characters are so colorful and the descriptive writing helped fuel my imagination of this world. My only minor complaint is that the story felt rushed towards the end. Everything wrapped up in a few quick chapters. Maybe it was just me not wanting to leave just yet, but it just seemed too quick.

Getting through this dense space opera is no easy task, though. I did it, though, and although I cannot understand why, I want to finish this trilogy, if only to find out how the transformation of Mars in these books is completed, or even if it is managed at all.I found Mr. Robinson's style mind-numbing at times.

I applaud the author's knowledge of Mars, but frankly, I found that often I did not care where on Mars the characters were or what it looked like. His penchant of focusing so closely on description of martian geography took something away from the ""gee-whiz"" adventure of it all.I did enjoy the occasional human drama of the story. Who knew that, if a bunch of brilliant scientists were sent on a Mission from Mars, with little or no reason to listen to their handlers back on Earth, their behavior would resemble that of young teenagers? I enjoyed their occasional broodings, their frequent hysterics, and their abilities to wrangle the simplest matters into the realm of high drama. Perhaps all of that is a function of the author's acumen, but it was fun nevertheless.I wondered quite often at the colony's ability to expand so quickly. The technologies presented near the beginning of the story are recongnizable, and probably a few of them we will have a handle on by the time we are able to journey to Mars, but the technology has gotten way out of reason by the end of the book. I don't think giant domes that can cover an entire martian crater will ever by physically possible, one hundred or five hundred years from now. Physics is physics.Overall, this novel was not a waste of time. I know, that's not a glowing endorsement, but it's all I can give."

I would not be comfortable sharing this with anyone under 17 or 18 years old, which is unfortunate because it is such an engrossing storyline. It is easy to see why this is a best selling series.

I cringed at the fact that the 'hero' of the story never stepped in to help the animal he loved so much when it was savagely beaten by the 'simon legree' type circus overseer. It is only by the grace of the writer that the elephant didn't strike out at all of the obnoxious people who let the beatings occur!Some of the other reviews say much of what I thought about this book and the writing. The characters are thin, not lovable, not anyone I root for ... with the one exception of the hero as an old man. That is better done than any of the rest.The interaction of him with the nurse, Rosemary, is more real than that with Marlena. I don't recommend this book for those who want good writing. This is rather amateurish in so many ways. I do admire that the author did the research... but her execution of the story and the story line leave a lot to be desired. I felt the writing and plot itself wasn't much above that of a 'bodice ripper'. I was disappointed."

There are more than just a few characters and relationships to follow to keep it interesting. It is a believable story of the future, almost like an advanced history. The unfolding of the characters and character relationships are a pleasure to read. The story continues to roll along at a good pace without being bogged down with too many extraneous details. For the multiplexer, it is a story that you can break away from periodically and are always glad to pick back up. Red Mars makes you think about the exploration of pristine environments and the politics of changing such environments.

The first sentence had a grammatical error, and the descriptions were too involved and wordy, so I was afraid I would be disappointed. I wasn't. It turned out to be a well-written book. Gruen actually took me to the circus world in the early thirties, and I lived it along with Jacob. Not only that, but seeing Jacob in his nineties, gives the reader a new appreciation for the elderly. Although I could have done without the cursing and gritty sex scenes, I still found the book interesting, at times delightful, and well worth the read."

Originally a villain in a 19th Century book called Tom Brown's Schooldays, Flashman was taken by Fraser and given a life far beyond that modest beginning. What makes Flashman such an outstanding character is that he is unredeemable: though he rarely aspires to acts of pure malice, he also never does anything worthwhile unless he can see a profit in it. He never repents from his minor evils and never really becomes a better person due to his misadventures.That said, the Harry in Flashman and the Redskins is almost a kinder and gentler version of previous incarnations. At least his general cowardice, greed and racism seem slightly less pronounced in this book (though it's still there). This book is the longest in the series thus far, but really it is a pair of connected shorter novels.The first part of the book follows right on the heels of Flash for Freedom!, which was a couple books ago (Fraser relates Flashman's tales in a non-chronological order). It is 1849, and Harry is accidentally an accessory to murder in New Orleans. Escape involves marrying a wealthy madame who is moving her brothel to California to take advantage of the Gold Rush (the fact that this is bigamy doesn't faze our hero one bit). From there, he will get entangled with nasty Indian hunters (How bad? Read Cormac McCarthy's Blood Meridian which features some of the same people and is one of the most relentlessly violent books I've ever read) and later some Apaches, including the future Geronimo.The second half of the book takes place in 1876. Now wealthy and regarded as a hero, Flashman is coerced by his wife into taking a tour of the United States. This will get Flashy mixed up with, among others, George Custer. Since Flashman seems to get in the middle of all sorts of historic battles, you can be sure he'll be at Little Big Horn. How he gets there involves some of his past sins coming to visit him in an unexpected way.As with the other books in the Flashman series, this is another historical novel with a sense of humor (however dark), something rarely found in that particular genre. It is also very well-written, offering a cynically alternative take on both historical events and historical figures (besides Geronimo and Custer, this novel also includes Ulysses Grant, Crazy Horse and Wild Bill Hickock among others). If you're new to this series, this book might not be the best place to start, but for existing fans, this is another fun read."

Excess verbiage needs trimming, and gaps need filling. As it stands, the book gets bogged down too much and too often.Entire parts could be distilled down to a chapter. ""Homesick"", in particular, reads like the author forgot he was writing a novel, and was just delivering his pet theories on psychology. ""Falling Into History"" consists largely of a planet-wide tour by John Boone, most of which seems to serve no other purpose than to illustrate that Mars is a planet, and planets are big. Yah, I knew that. ""Guns Under The Table"" could have been a lot shorter, given that it ends up being that none of the details had any bearing on the plot, the story, or the history.Descriptions of the magnificent desolation of the martian surface were really moving at the beginning. Unfortunately, the author apparently thinks the reader has a short attention span, for he can't go two pages without reiterating this, at times word for word. It gets to the point where one can recognize these from their lead-in and know to skip a paragraph. Or three.I found many of the characters shallow and one-dimensional, ""caricatures, not people"", as another reviewer put it. This was disappointing, as a few seemed to have some depth. Boone charisma's really came through (once the author finished shipping him all over the planet for no real purpose). I could really sympathize with Nadia at times (when the author wasn't hammering us with her tendency to engineer everything). But too many of could be summed in a few words and then omitted from the prose. ""I don't care what happens to these people.""Another irritation is that after slogging through all 572 pages, the ""end"" is very unfulfilling. In truth, the book doesn't end -- it just stops. I realize that ""real life"" often lacks neat endings, but this is fiction, and even history books manage to draw lines between events.All in all, if I knew it was going to be like this, I wouldn't have bothered."

For twelve years he has loved, cried, laughed, taught, dreamt, and lived with strangers. He is joyous when he sees the sails on the horizon. &quot;Long were the days of pain I have spent within its walls, and long were the nights of aloneness; and who can depart from his pain and aloneness without regret?&quot;What can a poor man leave for those he has learned to love? Almustafa walks through the city, across the sands, toward the shore; as he does, he pauses to answer the questions of the heart. &quot;Nor is it a thought I leave behind me, but a heart made sweet with hunger and thirst.&quot;His words will pass from generation to generation in Orphalese. The metaphor is reality, for the wisdom of his celebration of life is as powerful today as it was when it was published in 1923.Some of my favorite passages are:Of Joy and Sorrow -- &quot;The deeper the sorrow carves into your being, the more joy you can contain. Is not the cup that holds your wine the very cup that was burned in the potter's oven?&quot;Of Giving -- &quot;You give but little when you give of your possessions. It is when you give of yourself that you truly give.&quot;Of Reason and Passion -- &quot;Your reason and your passion are the rudder and the sails of your seafaring soul.&quot;Of Time -- &quot;You would make a stream upon whose bank you would sit and watch its flowing. Yet, the timeless in you is aware of life's timelessness. And knows that yesterday is but today's memory and tomorrow is today's dream.&quot;Each phrase carries you from one thought to another. The profoundness of his truth is not gleaned until the words are read many times. The Prophet by Kahlil Gibran is extraordinary, and will always be one of my favorite books of philosophy, poetry, wisdom, mysticism, and prose.Victoria Tarrani"

It's very non-linear; for example, the grip is not discussed until page 30, and the stance until page 110. Instead, this is more a book of collected observations about the game, its pleasures and pains, its pitfalls and secrets for success, and its personalities.Another thing it is not: a classically well-written book. After all, Harvey was a golf teacher, not an author (it appears that -- to his credit -- co-author Shrake allows Harvey's voice to come through, instead of completely rewriting his thoughts). What ultimately results is a slim volume full of both anecdotes and helpful tips (I have worked my way out of swing problems many times by going back to the Little Red Book).A complete instructional guide to the game? No. This is a modest work -- very appropriate to the quiet and gentle man who taught a U.S. Open champion, a Masters champion, and hundreds or thousands of lesser-known golfers whose ability and appreciation for the game were enhanced by their having known Harvey Penick."

However, he does remember a very interesting part of his life. It comes about one day when the news that a circus is in town and one of Jacob's fellow nursing home inmates brags about having worked at a circus and giving water to the elephants. Jacob knows the old man is full of it. After all, Jacob once worked at a circus. Rewind seventy-something years, to the 1930s, amid the Great Depression. Jacob is twenty-three, just weeks away from getting his degree in Cornwall University to become a certified veterinarian. Then he receives the news that his parents died in a terrible accident. He also discovers that they had no money -- they had invested every last penny on Jacob's Ivy League education. Distraught, Jacob runs away. By accident, he ends up on a train, destination unknown. He discovers that the train is actually one that carries a traveling circus. One thing leads to another, and he ends up working as a sort of unofficial caretaker for the animals. He meets August and his wife Marlena. Jacob learns many secrets to life as a circus performer and worker, meets lots of interesting people, and encounters some very unsavory things. August, for instance, is a very unstable, unpredictable person. He is abusive to the animals and insufferable one moment, and completely charming and obliging the next. The way he treats the animals, especially Rosie, the new performing elephant, makes Jacob sick, but he can't do anything about it. The Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth has its awful moments, but things get worse for Jacob when he falls in love with the beautiful Marlena...I like the way Water for Elephants changes from Jacob's present-day narrative as a cynical old man with early signs of dementia to his days as a nave young man and his struggles with wanting to fit into the Benzini Brothers and wanting to lose his virginity. The way his voice and narrative change is clear and precise and you get drawn into this unique and at times quirky novel. The backdrop of the Depression is wonderful and believable. The secondary characters are compelling, especially Walter, August, Uncle Al and Marlena. August is a horrible person, and the scenes centered on his abuse toward Rosie the elephant are indeed sickening. It's a good thing Gruen spares us from too much information in terms of the actual abuse. Rosie sounds adorable and I loved it when she was in the scenes. I very much enjoyed Water for Elephants. It's very moving and entertaining. No wonder it became a #1 New York Times bestseller! Even though the NYT list has never influenced my reading, especially since the stuff that makes the top list is mostly trash, it's nice to see that readers get it right every once in a while. Sara Gruen is a great author. I look forward to reading her future works."

In fact, I think many fantasy writers neglect the basics of medieval life whilst they stroke their immense swords. I'm also not one of the readers who get all self-righteous because an author takes too long to write a book. It's his living, his book and I am a paying customer, not an investor.Having said that, I was still somewhat disappointed by this latest instalment for basically the same reason outlined by others who have reviewed it: lack of progress.The key POV character storylines advance very little throughout the novel. Indeed, what little advancement they do make seems somewhat negated by the end points of the threads at the close of the book. Meanwhile, other threads just seem to vaporise and some of the new ones that are introduced are rendered somewhat pointless by their climaxes.In other words, the book seems about 95% padding and 5% substance.The use of journeys, both physical and mental, for so many of the characters is part of the problem. The plot lines become like so many tedious car trips. You watch the scenery roll past to the point of boredom, hoping against hope that there will be something of interest in the next town you enter. Only to realise that the next landmark is fairly much the same as the last.Of course Martin does throw in some of his trademark surprises at the end, but they're starting to become contrived. Worse still, the reappearance of some characters we thought killed now makes anyone else's apparent demise less certain. Like when Indiana Jones goes over a cliff and you just know that he's not going to fall to his death because, well, he's the *hero*.All up I won't give the book one star because it's still a very richly written piece of work. But it's not worth the price I paid for it on pre-order. Perhaps the worst condemnation I can give it is that if you did not read this book, I imagine that you could pick up the next one in the series and not have any trouble following the story."
6,3.52,0.9956,1988,08-02,2701200,The Raw Kitchen,W Palm Beach,,St Johns,West,11,"I read Jane Goodall's In the Shadow of Man (Houghton Mifflin 1971) years ago as research for a paleo-historic novel I was writing. I needed background on the great apes so I could show them acting appropriately in their primeval setting tens of thousands of years ago. While I did get a marvelous treatise from this book on their wild environ, I also got my first introduction to the concept that they are almost-human, maybe even human cousins.But I digress. Back to Jane Goodall.This is the memoir that began her career, that relays her start in the field of anthropology, how she conducted her early studies and the price she paid personally and professionally for her perseverance. She had no formal background in primatology or fieldwork when she began this study. She entered Tanzania with an open mind, a patient attitude and an interest in exploring the adventures of chimpanzees in the wild. From there, she invented everything else that would allow her to investigate these fascinating primates. In the book, she shares every step with readers--how she followed the chimps until they finally accepted her presence without fleeing, how she learned to identify each animal and in that way track their lives, how she learned to understand their verbal and body language, how she learned to be a better mother by watching Flo's parenting skills.At the time she wrote this book, chimpanzees were not considered human--still aren't. Goodall approached her fieldwork expecting to see them fail the tests of human-ness, things like using tools, caring for their families, working as a group, planning their actions. Each hurdle she put in front of them, they lept across, until her work destroyed all the rules about what made you and I human. She did for chimpanzees what Dian Fosse did for the gorillas and Birute Galdikas did for orangutans: she humanized them.By the time I finished this book, I realized that chimpanzees have a good and fulfilling life. They have adapted their lives to suit their environment. They lack man's wanderlust, restricting themselves to smaller and smaller parts of Africa every year, but by Jane Goodall's account, they enjoy their lives.Can we say as much for ourselves?"

He was an adventurer, a family man, a man who held interesting views on just about every subject under the sun, and finally, in his later years, a martyr to life. Although this book was written by Renoir's middle son, Jean, it is as vibrant and alive as if Renoir, himself, had just written the words in his own hand. Through this book we learn how the Renoir family left its roots in Limoges and moved to Paris. We read of Renoir's early years as a painter of porcelain and how and why he became an artist, more specifically, an Impressionist. We learn of Renoir's marriage to Aline Charigot of Essoyes, the birth of his three sons and his move to the south of France. Some of the most interesting sections of the book deal with Renoir's feelings about the effect of light on a painting and why he needed to paint in a &quot;natural&quot; setting. Also, most interesting are the chapters on the birth of Impressionism and Renoir's relationships with the other artists of the time, such as Monet, Manet, Sisley and Cezanne, just to name a few. Lovingly and charmingly written, this book truly brings Renoir to life and makes him accessible to all. Absolutely a must for anyone with even a passing interest in art or artists!"

The reader gets a close up view of the inner workings of the circus, the performers, animal caretakers, etc, mixed in with a love story of sorts. However, even though the book was good, it was not great. It's not one I'd want to keep, or read again. The author introduced too many characters too quickly, and only after reading on for awhile do you sort them out. I didn't really come to love any of the characters enough to care much about what happened to them. The plot seemed weak, character development weak. I liked the HBO series Carnivale, and although this is also a circus book, it was slightly disappointing to me."

I truly believe that this book IS for everyone. Unlike so much other 20th century literature, one need not be well read to get something out of it.The story is of two of man's most cherished and hated traditions: Love and War. The tragedy is that we have had so much of the latter and so little of the former. We see much of both in &quot;For Whom The Bell Tolls.&quot; It is a tender story of two young people who just want to live a &quot;normal&quot; life together during the Spainish civil war, but who are prevented from doing thus due to their being in the wrong place at the wrong time.It is incredulous to me that there were other reviewers who found this book &quot;boring.&quot; I can only surmise that anyone who would find a novel such as this boring will not find anything &quot;exciting&quot; unless it has Arnold Scharzenegger swinging around a machine gun. But that, I believe, is the fault of the reader's lack of attention span and cannot be blamed on Hemingway.The author writes that &quot;The world is a fine place and worth the fighting for and I hate very much to leave it.&quot; I would agree.

6,3.71,0.9957,1990,05-11,7428500,Pine Forest Vegetarian,Houston,,Minnesota,Southeast,6,"For Whom the Bell Tolls is one of Hemingway's masterpieces.The novel is set during the Spanish Civil War and at the center of it is Robert Jordan an American who has joined the international brigades supporting the democratic Spanish government against the Fascist insurgency led by Fransisco Franco. The focus is onJordan and the loyalist guerillas he is with and their mission of blowing up a key bridge which would enable the loyalists to trap a fascist army, The other part of the novel focuses on Jordans relationships with the guerillas particularily a young woman named Maria. Jordan and Maria fall in love and it is a compelling story but Jordans relationships with the guerilla leader Pablo and his wife Pilar as well as the other loyalists are also compelling. The novel has an air of tragedy about it for the fascists destroy a large loyalist army before the bridge can be demolished and we know that the Fascists end up winning the war. Jordan is one of Hemingways most compelling heroes and he carries the novels. You see Spain through his eyes and Hemingway makes you believe you are in Spain in late 1938.

Instead it perpetuates the romantic ideals set forth by Harlequin and its ilk -- heights that no three-dimensional male can ever reach. (No wonder it was a word-of-mouth bestseller.)This is shown most strikingly through Gruen's protagonist, Jacob Jankowski. He does not talk, think, or act like any (straight) man I have ever met. The purpose he serves, it seems, is to stand in for a lot of women's idea of what a man should be. When a man looks at another man and calls him ""unshaven"" with the implication that what he really means is ""unclean,"" you know you're nowhere near reality. This type of man lives only in fiction.Gruen even makes Jacob a virgin (though old enough to have a degree from veterinary school) so that when he and the female lead finally make it to the bed (which is inevitable in this world), it more closely match the unspoken wishes of her audience.(Now, understand, men's fiction is no better from the woman's point of view, with the hero more often than not bedding the female lead, who then conveniently dies so he can have access to a series of new women without guilt for the expense of a succession of prostitutes. I'm not saying it's any better, but at least it's marketed to men and not a general audience.)Gruen relies so much on stereotypes from romance novels (or even just their covers) and ""chick flicks"" that none of the characters in Water for Elephants ever feels like a real human being but simply an archetype playing its part in her story. The writing flows nicely, and the story is somewhat interesting if you don't mind melodrama.Also, Gruen manages to humanize people who have previously been seen as freaks, but this was all for nought when I never believed that the narrator was telling me the truth about his gender. I actually kept waiting for that to be a ""twist"" in the story, and in fact was disappointed when it never came.Plus, if a man were really telling the story, he would undoubtedly have recognized the sophomoric unintentional hilarity in the following passage: Teams of men are ... raising enormous poles.... I pass a group of ten throwing their combined weight against a single rope as a man off to the side chants, ""Pull it, shake it, break it! Again--pull it, shake it, break it! Now downstake it!""

While I loved the adventuring featured in this book, in the end, nothing really happened, there were no changes. My other problem with this book and all of his books is how he switches the point of view every chapter among multiple different characters. Each one is written very well, but the tone shifts with each character, and I end up reading the book chapter by chapter. I couldn't put the book down until I finished reading the chapter, but once it was over I had no desire to read what came next right away, unless it was one of my favorite characters. I also didn't like Jon Snows role in this book, he used to be one of my favorite characters, but in this one he was really bogged down by running the wall. Once again, in this book there were multiple main character deaths, which I find frustrating. Along with cliffhanger probably deaths, which if the people are actually dead I would be very upset and annoyed. It's nice to know that the characters are vulnerable, their victory isn't guaranteed, but I would still like for my favorite characters to win some of the time.My biggest fear with this series is that Martin might die before he finishes it. I don't mean any offense, but he doesn't look too healthy, and I doubt you could get someone to finish the series successfully. The fantasy world was lucky when Brandon Sanderson took over for Robert Jordan, I don't know if they'd be that lucky a second time. I hope that it won't take another 5 years to write each book, because he would then be 73, which is pushing it even for a healthy man.

Each installment seems to outdo its predecessor, thus giving rise to the suggestion made by others here that in this book O'Brian really hits his stride.In THE MAURITIUS COMMAND, Aubrey is awarded a commodore's pennant; his career continues to rise. Maturin's career as an intelligence officer and master of political influence is given prominent place as well.There are the requisite actions at sea, some of which do not feature Aubrey centrally. There is less of the romance novel aspect that slowed the story down in POST CAPTAIN.Aside from the usual attention to historical details in describing life in the turn-of-the-nineteenth century Royal Navy (at least from the standpoint of the officers), O'Brian continues his mastery of verbal and nonverbal interaction between characters. One gets a real feel for what these men are like in the way they respond to one another. What's more, O'Brian has a light hand in it; his humor emerges at the most opportune times.THE MAURITIUS COMMAND stands alone as a book better than the previous two novels; this novel has both a clear beginning and a clear ending. I nonetheless recommend reading the series from the beginning with MASTER AND COMMANDER. If you, too, fall in love with the books, welcome to the club, my friend!"

You don't just visualize the author's words, they leap off the page, and rather than watching the movie in your mind, you are living it. You feel the pain, the joy, the laughter. When the book is finished, you're more than disappointed. You feel invigorated, and you search eagerly through the author's books to see what, along the same vein, she has to offer. You search readers' recommendations to find the books that leave the same imprint on you. Inevitably, though the books satiate your appetite, they don't resonate in the same way. Welcome to Sara Gruen's Water for Elephants.In the prologue, we're privy to a murder. We see it as Jacob sees it, and tries in vain to stop it. Though the victim and murderer aren't named, as we're introduced to them, it becomes clear in our mind who filled those roles.Then we start from the beginning, in the midst of the Great Depression. Jacob is in class, during the final few weeks at Cornell preparing for his finals before he becomes a doctor of veterinary medicine.In a moment, the Dean will enter and change his path. Jacob was to go home and set up shop with his father, working with the animals in his town. Instead, he goes home to identify the remains of his mother and father. He sees the sign his father added to their on-site practice: Jankowitz and Son Veterinary Practice. After identifying his family, he visits the lawyer, who tells him he has nothing. The bank owns the house and everything in it. The explanation as to why his parents mortgaged the house shatters him. He returns to school to finish his finals and finds that he can't.Jacob flees and seeing a train pass, tries to jump aboard. Once on, he realizes it is a circus train. An old man, Camel, vouches for him and works to get him a job within.As soon as the boss finds he is Ivy League educated, degree or no degree, he becomes the animal man. With such a prestigious job within, he straddles the division between the higher ups and performers, and the lower echelon who helped secure his place.One performer in particular, Marlena, fascinates him. She reminds him physically of the girl he left behind at school, and emotionally captivates him. She matches his love of animals. Married to August, who has the boss' ear, she is off-limits, but a friendship develops anyway.Later comes Rosie, an elephant pilfered from a circus that has gone defunct. Rosie suffers August's wrath many, many times. Jacob is stunned by her human like qualities. Understanding, pain, anger, empathy, happiness all emanate from her big brown eyes.Following the story, I felt all of the emotions Rosie feels (except perhaps, the pain). Astonishment at the goings on to keep the circus running smoothly. The love Jacob develops for many people who help him in the course of creating a new life for himself, free of the memories surrounding his past. Sadness at the loss of animals, anger at the treatment of the animals and the red lighting of, as they're called today, carnies.The characters came alive to me, as did the setting. As soon as I finished this book, I eagerly went to Sara Gruen's website to read excerpts of other novels she had written. While good, they didn't capture me the way this did. And I wanted more of this. So I went to Amazon's recommendations Disappointedly, I moved on to Barnes and Noble. No dice. So I tried the next best thing. Research. I wanted to read first hand accounts of the circus the way it was back then. The more I read, the more I craved.Then, as though they knew my hunger, work offered me discounted tickets to the circus. I'm still debating. On the one hand, it's the circus. Elephants that feel things like people do! Horses that synchronize! How can I say no? On the other hand, it's not the 1920s. It's almost 100 years later. What if it's not the same? I mean true, we're in the middle of a depression (point 4 of pros: It's almost the same!). But people are categorically different than they were then. Theoretically, this extends to performers as well right?But alas, I have chosen to forego the circus at this moment, because I fear, like the recommendations of Barnes and Noble and Amazon, it may fall short. So I will hold onto the satisfaction this book gave me, and the hunger for more of the same. Hopefully, there will be another book that catches my attention like this one. And soon."

They are introduced to Hitler and members of the nazi hierarchy and so this historical epic begins. Revolving mainly around their two sons Byron and Warren the story takes us from the bombing of Warsaw to that fateful december morning at Pearl Harbour. When Victor Henry submits a report to his superiors predicting a secret pact between Russia and Nazi Germany and is proved correct his presence is immediately requested at the White House. From then on Roosevelt is impressed with what he sees and asks him to be his informal watchdog in Berlin and to keep his eyes and ears open. &quot;drop him a line every now and then&quot;. It is an assignment Victor Henry accepts with misgivings. The author weaves a convoluted tale of &quot;Pug&quot; Henrys meetings and confrontations with such historical figures as Roosevelt, Churchill, Mussolini and even Stalin. I learnt more here about major european battles and the background political drama than I ever learnt at college. It also captured the complicated politics of the time and explained the unlikly pact Hitler made with the soviets, their supposed arch enemies.It also dwelt in quite some detail with the intricacies of lend-lease which many americans were against at the time. Also with the fictional device of a memoir written by a retired wehrmacht general we are given a german perspective on the war and their reasons for its outcome. The germans Henry tells us laconically have a habit of blaming other countries for getting invaded by them. I had to nod in agreement at captain Henrys comment when asked by Roosevelt what he thought of Hitler &amp; Stalin. Henry's reply was that from his perspective most presidents and primeministers were more alike than they were different. Aint that the truth. The story also includes the romance, anguish, pain and suffering of war and all that entails. I also liked how the author descibed the ambience of the time. The streets of London and Berlin and Washington. What woman were wearing. What people were eating. It all just helped to create a more effective story. Give it a go even if you havent read a historical novel before you just might be surprised."

From the opening line on Chapter 1 all the way to the end, you are hooked.A young veterinary student loses is parents tragically during the time of the depression. After having his family house repossesed by the bank and no prospects, he winds up working in a circus.As stated in other reviews, there are some shaky transitions and predictable plot points. But there is a sincerity to the book that works and unique setting that makes one easily forgive the story's few shortcomings.And it's the setting that I really liked about this book. It brings back the circus of old and it made me miss it. The smell of animals and hay. The popcorn and cotton candy. The acrobats with the sequined vests. You get a wonderful ""behind the scenes"" insight to a peice of nostalgic Americana. Combined with classic dramatic elements and a motley cast of characters, this is a great book and I'm glad I got it."

What was circus life like during the Depression? Don't let the topic discourage you from reading this book. I was captured by the first line: ""I am ninety. Or ninety-three. One or the other."" As I was reading this book, I could see the whole story play out in my mind as the author easily transitioned the storyteller from the present day back to the 1930's and his life on a circus train.

After a tragic accident involving his parents, Jacob feels lost and unsure of his future. One night he hops a train - only to find that he's hopped a circus train. Because he is ""almost"" a vetrenarian they welcome him aboard (although not that nicely or easily) and he quickly becomes embroiled in a very predictable love triangle.Gruen does a great job with the transition from the ruminations of 93 year-old Jacob in the nursing home to 22 year-old Jacob on the traveling circus. They're seemless and very well done. Reading about the circus and life on a traveling circus during the depression era was also interesting.My complaint with the novel lies in the fact that as a reader I felt the author just skimmed the surface with this novel. The story was predictable and shallow, and while the characters were decently developed, the overall story line just wasn't that great, IMHO.I was disappointed."

The story starts off in an engaging way, Jake the old man in the nursing home was entertaining. But there were too many instances of animals being abused/killed that I could not finish this book as it seemed to become the main focus. Too many animals in life are mistreated as it is and I do not need this information shoved in my face via a novel. This book should come with a warning to potential readers right on the front cover."

There was no money as he sat to take his final exam to become a veterinarian. Feeling desperate Jacob jumps on a moving train instead. Having no idea he has jumped on a circus train, he decides he has nothing left and starts working with the circus. He meets a beautiful woman, Marlena, but finds out quickly she is married to a mad-man. However, she returns the attraction and a great love story begins.Water for Elephants is a compelling story that tells us all about growing old, corrupt management, animal cruelty, wonderful animals, kindness and loyalty between people and between people and animals in a world where indifference and cruelty are common.The author's obvious extensive research of history and circus life added so much interest to the background of a wonderful meaningful, love story.This is such a wonderful read and well worth your time!"

The first couple books were great, but in a ""Feast for Crows"" nothing happened, and worst, nothing happened to characters I didn't like. Now we're back to finding out about Bran; some more stuff about Arya (yay!); and best of all lots about Daenarys, Tyrion, and Jon. Thankfully there was nothing about Sansa nor Brienne (both of whom are nice, but both of whom are honestly kind of boring); and thankfully little about Cersei!!! Cersei is interestingly warped, but I can't read 300+ pages about her, and by the end of the previous book I wanted to scream. Jaime isn't even interestingly warped (his back-story is complicated, but in practice he's just some dude who f***ed his sister), and I really wasn't interested in reading 300+ pages of HIM.The book is pretty slow, but that's fine. Some of it I skimmed, especially when there were 20 odd page chunks of digressions about the family life, philosophy and genealogy of some character I'd never heard of and was unlikely to hear of again. Let's be honest, about 25% of the the series is the plain and simple wankery of some guy geeking out on building the arcane details of some imaginary world that any sane editor would red-pen. But the rest of it is great, and enjoyable. This was a welcome addition to the series. Finally."

(I thought that Sum of All Fears was pushing it.) But Without Remorse is quite another story. Here Clancy reveals himself to be a real facist. Certainly the victims of Kelly/Clark's rage are not innocents, but they are pointless executed, and the book doesn't even take the time to explore the effect that this has on Clark or really give him any kind of depth. In Lethal Weapon, we only know that Riggs's wife is dead, this alone is enough to make him suicidal and add considerable depth to his character. In Without Remorse, the love interest's death is only exploited to give Clark an excuse to kill everyone. I found Clancy's obvious animus towards liberals and women distasteful and his lack of respect for human life and even a sense of the impact that taking another person's life has on your own--well, it is truely baffling to consider how a man who is marginally an intellectual can be that primative. He falls short even of the mark that his other novels set. One is better off with any of his previous works, especially Clear and Present Danger or Cardinal of the Kremlin."

Each installment seems to outdo its predecessor, thus giving rise to the suggestion made by others here that in this book O'Brian really hits his stride.In THE MAURITIUS COMMAND, Aubrey is awarded a commodore's pennant; his career continues to rise. Maturin's career as an intelligence officer and master of political influence is given prominent place as well.There are the requisite actions at sea, some of which do not feature Aubrey centrally. There is less of the romance novel aspect that slowed the story down in POST CAPTAIN.Aside from the usual attention to historical details in describing life in the turn-of-the-nineteenth century Royal Navy (at least from the standpoint of the officers), O'Brian continues his mastery of verbal and nonverbal interaction between characters. One gets a real feel for what these men are like in the way they respond to one another. What's more, O'Brian has a light hand in it; his humor emerges at the most opportune times.THE MAURITIUS COMMAND stands alone as a book better than the previous two novels; this novel has both a clear beginning and a clear ending. I nonetheless recommend reading the series from the beginning with MASTER AND COMMANDER. If you, too, fall in love with the books, welcome to the club, my friend!"

With the recent release of the movie, I decided to pull my copy on loan from my bookshelf and read it before venturing out to the theater to see the movie (or, more likely now, renting it).Water for Elephants is definitely different from the other fiction I normally read. The book takes place after the Great Depression, and Gruen did a lot of research surrounding circuses during that time to influence her book. Many of the chapters began with a picture from circus archives, which really added to the experience of reading the book. I absolutely loved how the chapters alternated between the main character's experience in his early 20's as the circus veterinarian and as a 93-year-old man in a nursing home. It really made me think about the stories of my own grandparents, who are nearing their 90's themselves.The diverse cast of characters in the circus also made the drama of circus life a fascinating read. I had no idea of the caste system in circus life, the treatment of employees and animals alike, and how competitive circus troupes were during this challenging era in U.S. history.I have heard that the book is better than the movie. I admit that I am a bit skeptical about the movie given some of the casting choices for its main characters. But, like any avid book lover, I do intend to see the movie to see how it compares to one of the best books I've read so far this year. I highly recommend this book for those who want a story with adventure, romance, and excitement under the big top."

You have more tight, evocative language that conjure up the landscapes the characters live in, and wonderful characterisation so that you fully engage and sympathise with them. This is a great look at the Spanish civil war from the guerrillas point of view, with the assistance of an American explosives expert. It has romance, chivalry, betrayal, adventure and the rougher side of human nature. What more could you want from one novel? If you like Hemingway then this is another great novel and if you're new to him, this may not be the best starting place, but you'll still not be disappointed.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."

I could give you all my very detailed opinion of this book -- I loved it, it would be easy -- but I would never do the book justice. Suffice to say the characters are marvelously drawn (years later I still think about them) and the plot marvelously intricate. I've even gotten my mom and sister to read the Trilogy and they both loved it. What it all comes down to is you should buy it (or borrow it if you must to get your hands on it) and read it (and the other two in the Trilogy --&gt; Green Mars &amp; Blue Mars).

We haven't discussed the book in my reading group yet, but I think that the book raises a lot of good points for discussion (i.e. &quot;would we have done X this way? Would there be alternatives?&quot;).My biggest complaint with the book was his rambling ad infinitum about the Martian land features. I honestly believe that the book could have been 150 pages shorter, and equally enjoyable to me if he'd have left out most of this. In fact, it appeared to me that characters made often seemingly pointless treks around Mars just so the author would have a reason to describe each area. I think I may have been so put off simply because I have absolutely no interest in geology, but the other people in my reading group felt pretty much the same way. This was my only real complaint with the book, but it was such a complaint that I docked it two stars.Overall, I'm pretty sure I wouldn't have given the book a Nebula award, but barring the complaint above, I found it to be very thought provoking, and I look forward to discussing it with my reading group.

The first part of the book captured my attention. I loved hearing about the colonization of Mars and the first 100. I got a bit lost in the middle of the book when it focused on political intrigue and the varying options of how Mars should be settled and what the future should look like. It lost the wonder of the first section. However, the conclusion was fantastic. The planet wide war was fascinating and the final conclusion kept me on the edge of my seat.

I really enjoyed ""The Voyage Out"" and the character development (even though, for me, the characters were not very likable). When they got to Mars, the book seemed to slow way down. The same features of Mars are explained over and over again. The author only has to tell me once that the sand/cliff/mountain/sky/terrain is red/rust/orange/crimson/brown/tan...I get it already! I do agree with other reviewers who say that 150-200 pages of describing Mars could have been left out to make a much more enjoyable book.The parts about the colonization were technically interesting, but overpowered with political issues (not a favorite SciFi topic of mine). While I think the events were a realistic expectation for people under such a situation, it just makes for very dry reading.

5,3.15,0.99454,1985,02-08,3640600,Sai India Curry,Las Vegas,,Kentucky,West,12,Twists and turns. The book is based on actual historical facts blended with a great fictional story line. It is full of believable characters.
5,3.34,0.9906,2015,02-10,5726300,Papas Pizza To Go,Springfield,,Lafayette,East,16,this one- book 5 is so...fast paced! we are traveling quickly to so many places- like a locomotive nearing it's final destination- you can feel the electricity in the air of everything 'coming to a head' ... an exciting read!
6,3.64,0.9911,1998,03-31,3754400,Nature's Food Market & Juice Bar,Bakersfield,,Richmond,East,14,"I picked this up not knowing a thing about it except the blurb, so I was pleasantly surprised to find this story of love and betrayal under the big top one of the most engaging tales I've read in a long while. I'm not much into romance, but this is so much more than that so I couldn't pull myself away. As a bonus I learned about the dark side of the circus industry during that era. Gaslighting, where they throw the circus hands off the train in the middle of the night to avoid having to pay them, was a new term to me. Despite the cut-throat world they live in, the young veterinarian protagonist and the circus star he has a crush on, try to rise above it all at risk of life and limb.What tops it off is the story has one of the most satisfying endings I've encountered in a long time. I've passed my book along to my mother and it has since gone through the hands of three of my sisters. They all loved it. I'm a big fan."

6,2.98,0.9984,1993,10-06,3720600,,Gramercy,,Tennessee St,Southeast,15,"I give up. I can't even finish reading this because it's just too painful to experience the disconnect from the previous books in the series. Nothing much seems to happen, characters argue and talk and eat and travel. When things do happen they don't really seem to make sense. Most chapters involving characters from the first three books just don't ring true in some way.I'm not completely convinced that GRRM actually wrote the majority of this book. It simply doesn't build on what has come before. Old characters spin their wheels while unnecessary new characters pop into existence. The only explanation I can think of is that this book was constructed and edited with future seasons of the TV series in mind.Dance With Dragons feels like it was ghost written by somebody who has no real emotional connection to the old characters. Classic TV plot devices like cliffhangers and reversed deaths are used with abandon. Shocking dramatic events often had a huge emotional impact in the earlier books. But here they just feel like manipulative plot devices for ending a TV episode.It's really quite shocking just how bad this huge, meandering mess of a book is. It's hard for me to imagine anybody giving it a five star review. But, then again, I always underestimate the degree to which people become emotionally invested in works of fiction.My advice is to avoid this book. In fact, don't even start the book series if you haven't already. Just enjoy the HBO TV series. The producers on HBO are likely to keep the plot moving along nicely. Also you are guaranteed to get one new season per year for as long as it runs. In contrast the book series has jumped the rails, hurtled down the ravine and crashed into a great steaming mass of debris."

7,3.08,0.99142,1992,07-21,1444300,Secret Spot,,USD 0.00-25.00,Eastern Illinois,West,15,"Every Herman Wouk book I have read has been incredible, but this one takes first prize.The Winds of War is a work of historical fiction about the lead up to the outbreak of World War II in Europe (it had, of course already begun in Asia between Japan and China and other Asian neighbors) and the effect of the war on an American military family. It ends when America enters the war. The sequel, War and Remembrance continues the story through the end of the war.The main character, Victor Henry, a Commander in the United States Navy is sent to Germany just before the beginning of the war as a naval attache in the American embassy. He is the gruff career military man with compassion and love just below the surface and easily recognized by anyone except his family. His wife Rhoda is a Washington, DC socialite who was captivated by Victor but is now restless in her life as an officer's wife.Victor and Rhoda have three children, Warren, the eldest who follows his father into the Navy and puts in for flight training, a daughter who is a less developed character and the aptly named Byron, a dreamer and a sensitive man who bridles under his father's influence and flees college to Siena, Italy, where he becomes an assistant to the American Jewish writer, Aaron Jastrow and falls in love with his daughter Natalie.Victor Henry has something of Zelig in him and is a bit player in many important events of the time. He attends a weekend retreat of high-ranking Nazis and has meetings with FDR.Byron's employer Aaron Jastrow is a complex man, both running from his roots as a Yeshiva boy in Poland, and the product of those roots. Natalie is a perfect picture of an American ex-pat woman living in Europe (first Paris than Italy) in the heyday of Americans living abroad. And all of us can empathize with Byron, the young man who has not yet found his way in the world.All these characters are set against the backdrop of the precursor to war and the beginning of the war. For instance, one of the best sections of the book is an extremely harrowing but vivid section in which Byron, Natalie and Natalie's lover get stuck in Poland as the Nazis begin their occupation of that country.The fact that Wouk can seamlessly weave this web of characters into the tumultuous time in the late 1930s and early 1940s is a testament to a great author. Indeed, I am writing this review at least 10 years after finishing the book, yet it is all vivid in my mind.One final note that deserves mention: Wouk treats us to several sections of a fictional book within a book. After the war, Victor Henry translates a book by a German World War II general. Wouk intersperses excerpts of this fictional book throughout the story, providing a seemingly totally realistic view from a German nationalist who fought for the Nazis (although was not a Nazi himself).A must read for anyone who would describe himself or herself as any of the following: (a) a history or historical fiction fan, (b) a fan of epic romance, (c) anyone interested in World War II, (d) anyone interested in the Navy."

Pro,Rhome,,Wake Forest,Midwest,2,This is a real page turner.  I started it yesterday and I cant seem to put it down.  It shows you what it must have been like to be part of a traveling circus in the 20's.
6,3.19,0.9969,2011,05-17,10024400,The Root Cafe,,USD 25.00-40.00,Florida St,Southwest,10,"Great book, came in mint condition. Cool edition. Hopefully they will give us a hardcover box set soon. I love this book and cant wait for the next one."
6,3.14,0.9959,1993,04-30,3633000,A Meatball Joint,Wexford,,Temple,West,7,Martin's tales of fantasy and fratricide are great fun. Love Danny and her dragons. Tyrion is the best dwarf character since Snow White's crew.
6,3.13,0.99395,1993,03-18,1814800,,New York,USD 0.00-25.00,Southern Illinois,Midwest,14,"I found this novel to be interesting as it takes the reader into the world of silk making and the dressmaker and her granddaughter Lenore who marries into the prestigious and wealthy family of the Sallonger, who owns the silk. There one will find the secrets of violent and mysterious acts and the shadow that plagues of deceit that touches everyone involved in this world. The drawback of the novel is that there are many repeated paragraphs that tries to make inference to the importance of the scenes, but if you can bypass this little annoyance than you will be caught up into the world of the Silk Vendetta.  augie"
